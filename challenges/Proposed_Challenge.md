# Challenge #6 (Crypto Focus): European Crypto Licensing Navigator

## The Problem

The European crypto licensing landscape is in a state of unprecedented flux. MiCAR is rolling out across the EU, national VASP regimes are being phased out or modified, Switzerland offers a distinct path through VQF and FINMA, and the interplay between crypto-specific and traditional financial services regulation creates genuine complexity.

### Current State Pain Points

1. **Regime fragmentation**: A crypto business targeting Europe faces a patchwork — MiCAR in the EU (with varying national implementation), the FCA registration regime in the UK, VQF/FINMA in Switzerland, distinct frameworks in Liechtenstein. Understanding which regimes apply to which activities in which markets is genuinely hard.

2. **MiCAR transition complexity**: MiCAR introduces harmonised EU rules but with transitional provisions that vary by member state. Existing nationally-authorised firms have grandfathering options. New entrants face different pathways depending on timing and activities. The transition period creates significant uncertainty.

3. **Activity classification challenges**: Does a particular token constitute an ART, EMT, or "other crypto-asset" under MiCAR? Is a service "custody," "exchange," or "transfer"? Is the business model actually MiFID-regulated because the token qualifies as a financial instrument? These classification questions are foundational but often unclear.

4. **Multiple overlapping regimes**: A single crypto business might need MiCAR authorisation for crypto-asset services, EMI or PI licensing for fiat payment elements, MiFID authorisation if dealing in security tokens, and AML registration in each operating jurisdiction. Mapping these overlaps is complex.

5. **Practical intelligence gap**: Which national competent authority is fastest? What do regulators actually focus on in crypto applications? How long does VQF membership really take? This practical knowledge exists but isn't systematised.

6. **Fast-moving regulatory environment**: MiCAR technical standards are still being finalised. National implementations diverge. Enforcement postures are evolving. Guidance emerges frequently. Keeping current is a constant challenge.

## The Challenge

Build a tool that guides crypto businesses and their advisers through the European licensing landscape — identifying required authorisations, mapping transition pathways, and providing practical process guidance across MiCAR, Swiss, and other relevant European regimes.
