FINMA CIRCULAR 2008/21: OPERATIONAL RISKS -- BANKS
====================================================

1. OVERVIEW AND PURPOSE
The FINMA Circular 2008/21 "Operational Risks -- Banks" (Rundschreiben 2008/21
"Operationelle Risiken -- Banken") is a key regulatory instrument issued by the
Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA). It substantiates
Articles 89-94 of the Capital Adequacy Ordinance (CAO / ERV) and sets out both
basic qualitative requirements for the management of operational risks, and
quantitative requirements for determining operational risk capital.

The circular incorporates the "Principles for the Sound Management of
Operational Risk" issued in June 2011 by the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision (BCBS), transposed into six thematic principles. The circular
establishes that responsibility for the management of operational risks lies
with top management and requires banks to have in place systematic approaches,
systems and controls, reporting mechanisms, and IT infrastructure that
appropriately identify, limit, and monitor these risks.

Originally issued on 20 November 2008, the circular was partially revised
with an effective date of 1 January 2015, and further amended through
31 October 2019. It was ultimately superseded by FINMA Circular 2023/1
"Operational Risks and Resilience -- Banks" effective 1 January 2024.

NOTE: This document describes the provisions of Circular 2008/21 as last
amended, which remained in force until 31 December 2023. Capital requirement
provisions (margin nos. 3-116) continue to apply until the entry into force
of the CAO revised as part of the final Basel III revision package.

2. LEGAL BASIS
- Federal Act on the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMASA),
  Art. 7 para. 1 let. b (authority to issue circulars)
- Banking Act (BankA / BankG), Art. 3 et seq.
- Banking Ordinance (BankO / BankV), Art. 12 (organizational requirements)
- Stock Exchange and Securities Trading Act (SESTA / BEHG), Art. 19-20
- Capital Adequacy Ordinance (CAO / ERV), Art. 89-94 (operational risks)
- FINMA Circular 2008/10 "Self-regulation as a minimum standard"
- Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, "Principles for the Sound
  Management of Operational Risk" (June 2011)
- Swiss Bankers Association (SBA) recommendations on BCM

3. SCOPE OF APPLICATION
The circular applies to:
- Banks licensed under the Banking Act (BankA)
- Securities dealers (now securities firms under FinIA)
- Financial groups and conglomerates
- Swiss branches of foreign banks

The principle of proportionality governs the application of qualitative
requirements: banks of supervisory categories 4 and 5 are deemed "small
banks" and are exempted from certain provisions as specified in
margin no. 119.

FINMA may conduct institution-specific assessments based on type, scope,
complexity, and risks to apply additional or modified requirements even
for banks that would otherwise benefit from exemptions.

4. DEFINITION AND TAXONOMY OF OPERATIONAL RISKS
Operational risk is defined per Art. 89 CAO as:
"The danger of losses occurring as a result of the inadequacy or failure
of internal processes, people, or systems, or as a result of external
events."

This definition encompasses but is not limited to:
- Legal risks and compliance failures
- Fraud offences (internal and external)
- Information technology failures
- Business disruption events
- Employment practices and workplace safety incidents
- Damage to physical assets
- Process management failures
- Clients, products, and business practices failures

Capital requirements shall apply to both expected and unexpected losses.
Strategic risk and reputational risk are excluded from the operational
risk definition for capital calculation purposes, but remain subject to
general risk management requirements.

4.1 Basel Event Type Categories (Appendix 2)
The circular requires categorization of loss events in accordance with
Appendix 2, which mirrors the Basel II event type classification:
  (a) Internal fraud
  (b) External fraud
  (c) Employment practices and workplace safety
  (d) Clients, products, and business practices
  (e) Damage to physical assets
  (f) Business disruption and system failures
  (g) Execution, delivery, and process management

6. OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK

6.1 Principle 1: Responsibilities (Margin Nos. 121-124)
The governing body for overall management, supervision, and control (board
of directors) must:
- Approve and regularly review a framework for the management of
  operational risks
- Define the institution's risk appetite and risk tolerance for
  operational risks
- Ensure that senior management effectively implements operational risk
  policies and procedures
- Supervise management to verify that appropriate controls are in place

Risk appetite is defined as the deliberate acceptance of specific individual
"risks with wide-ranging implications" by the board of directors. This risk
appetite must be restricted by means of tolerance limits.

Senior management (executive board / Geschaeftsleitung) is responsible for:
- Implementing the operational risk framework approved by the board
- Translating the framework into specific policies and procedures
- Establishing clear lines of responsibility for managing operational risks
- Ensuring adequate resources are allocated to operational risk management
- Reporting regularly to the board on the operational risk profile

An independent organisational unit responsible for managing operational risks
shall be designated (margin no. 123). This unit is responsible for proactive
management measures resulting from a forward-looking perspective (e.g.
emerging risks) and recommending action items to senior management
(margin no. 124).

6.2 Principle 2: Framework and Control System (Margin Nos. 125-127)
Banks must establish and maintain a comprehensive operational risk management
framework (framework concept) that includes:
- Policies and procedures for identifying, assessing, monitoring, and
  controlling/mitigating operational risks
- A clearly defined governance structure with well-defined roles and
  responsibilities at all levels
- Risk assessment tools and methodologies
- Internal controls and compliance functions
- Integration of operational risk management into the overall risk
  management framework
- Adequate documentation of all policies, processes, and procedures

The framework must be appropriate to the nature, scale, and complexity of
the bank's activities and be subject to regular review and updating.

Specific operational risks with far-reaching implications must be managed
and controlled more comprehensively and intensely than set out by the
basic qualitative requirements. Executive management must situationally
define and implement additional risk-specific measures or tighten existing
measures.

6.3 Principle 3: Identification, Mitigation and Monitoring (Margin Nos. 128-130)
Banks must implement processes and systems to:
- Systematically identify operational risks across all activities and
  business lines
- Assess the potential impact and likelihood of identified risks
- Develop and implement measures to mitigate significant risks
- Continuously monitor operational risk exposures and loss events
- Maintain operational risk databases and loss event records
- Conduct regular self-assessments and scenario analyses
- Use key risk indicators (KRIs) to provide early warning of
  changing risk profiles

Methods for allocating capital for operational risks to major business
lines must be established, creating incentives to improve the management
of operational risks throughout the institution.

6.4 Principle 4: Internal and External Reporting (Margin Nos. 131-134)
Banks must establish comprehensive reporting mechanisms for operational risks:
- Regular internal reports to the board of directors and senior management
  on the operational risk profile
- Timely escalation of significant operational risk events
- External reporting to FINMA as required
- Reporting to auditors and other relevant stakeholders
- Reports on the status of the operational risk management framework
- Trend analyses and key risk indicator dashboards

The scope and frequency of reporting must be appropriate to the size and
complexity of the institution and the nature of its operational risk
exposures.

7. IT RISK MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS

7.1 Principle 5: Technological Infrastructure (Margin No. 135)
Banks must maintain appropriate IT infrastructure that supports the
identification, limitation, and monitoring of operational risks. This
principle requires:

- An overview of the IT network environment and systems landscape
- Systematic processes for identifying and assessing IT risks
- Appropriate monitoring and mitigation measures for IT risks
- Safeguards against business disruption from IT failures
- Adequate IT security measures
- Capacity planning and performance monitoring
- Regular testing of IT systems and infrastructure

Banks must develop and maintain a concept addressing:
(a) Comprehensive mapping of the IT environment, including hardware,
    software, networks, and data centres
(b) Identification and classification of IT assets by criticality
(c) Systematic assessment of IT risks, including threats and
    vulnerabilities
(d) Implementation of IT controls proportionate to identified risks
(e) Monitoring of IT operations and security events
(f) Incident detection and response capabilities for IT events

7.2 Cybersecurity Requirements
The circular (as amended in 2017) introduced specific provisions on
cyber risk management within Principle 5:
- Banks must develop concepts for identifying and responding to
  cyber attacks
- Cyber-attack identification and response protocols must be established
- Regular testing of cyber defences is required
- Banks must implement monitoring capabilities for detecting cyber
  intrusions and anomalous behaviour
- Scenario analysis on cyber threats shall be conducted
- Incident response plans specific to cyber events must be maintained

Further guidance on cyber risk reporting is provided in FINMA Guidance
05/2020, which specifies reporting obligations under Art. 29(2) FINMASA
for significant cyber attacks.

7.3 Change Management
IT change management processes must ensure that:
- Changes to IT systems are properly authorized, tested, and documented
- Impact assessments are conducted before implementing changes
- Rollback procedures are available in case of failed changes
- Production environments are protected from unauthorized changes
- Version control and configuration management are maintained
- Post-implementation reviews are conducted

8. DATA MANAGEMENT AND PROTECTION

8.1 Appendix 3: Handling of Electronic Client Identifying Data (CID)
Appendix 3 of the circular sets out nine principles and corresponding
specifications on the proper management of risks related to the
confidentiality of electronic personal data of natural persons ("private
clients") whose banking business is managed in or from Switzerland.

These principles are principally tailored to the risk of events relating
to the confidentiality of mass client data when using electronic systems.

8.2 Categories of Client Identifying Data (CID)
The circular distinguishes three categories of CID:

(a) Direct CID: All unique identifiers that allow the direct identification
    of a client, including names, signatures, email addresses, physical
    addresses, and company identifiers.

(b) Indirect CID: Information that identifies clients only when combined
    with other data, such as passport numbers, social security numbers,
    account numbers, card numbers, and IP addresses.

(c) Potentially Indirect CID: Data enabling identification only with
    additional context and special circumstances, including birth dates,
    nationality, professional qualifications, and transaction data.

8.3 Nine Principles for CID Protection (Appendix 3)

Principle 1 -- Governance:
Banks must systematically identify, limit, and monitor risks in connection
with the confidentiality of electronic client data. The board of directors
shall supervise management to ensure effective implementation of procedures
for safeguarding confidentiality of electronic client data. Management
shall entrust an independent entity as a controlling function to establish
and maintain a framework for safeguarding confidentiality of electronic
client data.

Principle 2 -- Data Inventory and Classification:
Banks must maintain a comprehensive inventory of CID, including
classification by sensitivity level (direct, indirect, potentially
indirect). The location of all CID must be documented, and data flows
must be mapped.

Principle 3 -- Access Management:
Access to CID must be clearly regulated with a role- and task-specific
authorisation system. Access should occur only on a strict need-to-know /
need-to-have basis. Cross-functional and cross-border access must be
subject to enhanced controls.

Principle 4 -- Security Standards for Infrastructure and Technology:
Security standards for infrastructure and technology applied for the
protection of CID confidentiality must adequately reflect the complexity
and risk exposure of the bank. Standards must safeguard the protection
of CID:
- At endpoints (personal computers, notebooks, portable storage devices,
  smartphones)
- During transfer (within networks or between different locations)
- In storage (databases, archives, backups)

If CID is stored abroad or if access to CID is possible from abroad,
FINMA requires appropriate protection (e.g. anonymisation, encryption,
or pseudonymisation) in addition to compliance with the Data Protection
Act.

Principle 5 -- Employee Awareness and Training:
Banks shall ensure that employees handling CID are aware of their
obligations regarding data confidentiality. Regular training and
awareness programmes must be provided.

Principle 6 -- Logging and Monitoring:
Access to and processing of CID must be logged and monitored. Anomalous
access patterns or unauthorized data transfers must be detected and
investigated promptly.

Principle 7 -- Outsourcing of CID Processing:
When selecting providers of outsourcing services that will process CID,
confidentiality must be a decisive criterion and an integral component
of the underlying due diligence. The bank shall continue to be ultimately
responsible for CID during the entire life cycle of the outsourced
services. Requirements are mandatory for all types of activities that
involve access to mass CID, including third-party providers of IT
services, support for installation and maintenance of externally
developed IT platforms, hosting of applications, and similar services.
(See also FINMA Circular 2018/3 "Outsourcing -- Banks".)

Principle 8 -- CID Incident Management and Communication:
Banks shall introduce pre-defined processes to react swiftly in case of
CID-related incidents. This includes:
- A clear strategy of communication (to FINMA, law enforcement authorities,
  and media) in case of severe CID incidents
- Analysis and reporting of exceptions, incidents, supervision and
  inspection results to top management
- Formalised processes to identify CID-related incidents and reaction
  schemes communicated to all relevant positions within the bank

Principle 9 -- Risks Arising from Cross-Border Activities:
Banks must identify and manage risks related to the cross-border
transmission and storage of CID, including compliance with applicable
data protection regulations in relevant jurisdictions.

9. BUSINESS CONTINUITY MANAGEMENT (BCM)

9.1 Principle 6: Continuity in Event of Business Interruptions (Margin No. 136)
This principle establishes requirements for business continuity management.
FINMA Circular 2008/10 "Self-regulation as a minimum standard" recognises
the SBA (Swiss Bankers Association) recommendations for BCM as a minimum
standard. The circular states that where the risk of business disruption
constitutes an "operational risk with wide-ranging implications," the
implementation of further-reaching qualitative measures is expected.

Banks must establish and maintain:
- Business Impact Analysis (BIA) identifying critical business processes
  and supporting resources
- Business Continuity Plans (BCP) for maintaining or restoring critical
  operations in the event of disruption
- Recovery strategies aligned with defined recovery time objectives (RTO)
  and recovery point objectives (RPO)
- Regular testing and exercising of BCM plans against severe but
  plausible scenarios
- Crisis management structures and communication plans
- Defined escalation procedures for business disruption events

9.2 Disaster Recovery Planning
Banks must establish disaster recovery plans (DRP) as part of their
overall BCM framework. Key requirements include:
- Identification of critical IT systems and infrastructure components
- Definition of recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point
  objectives (RPO) for each critical system
- Establishment of alternative processing sites or arrangements
- Regular backup of critical data and testing of restoration procedures
- Documentation of recovery procedures
- Regular testing and updating of disaster recovery plans
- Coordination between business continuity and disaster recovery
  planning

10. OUTSOURCING OF OPERATIONAL FUNCTIONS

The management of operational risks related to outsourcing is addressed
in the circular in conjunction with FINMA Circular 2018/3 "Outsourcing
-- Banks" (formerly Circular 2008/7). Key principles include:

- The bank retains ultimate responsibility for outsourced operational
  functions and their associated risks
- Outsourcing decisions must include a thorough risk assessment
- Service level agreements must include provisions for operational
  risk management, reporting, and audit rights
- Banks must ensure that outsourced activities are subject to
  appropriate internal controls
- Contingency plans must exist for critical outsourced services
- Due diligence must be conducted on service providers, with
  confidentiality as a decisive criterion for CID-related activities
- Ongoing monitoring and periodic review of outsourcing arrangements
  are required

For outsourcing involving access to mass CID (client identifying data),
the requirements under Appendix 3 Principle 7 apply with full force
(see section 8.3 above).

11. TECHNOLOGY RISK ASSESSMENT

Banks must conduct regular and systematic assessments of technology-
related risks. This includes:
- Identifying technology dependencies across all business lines
- Assessing single points of failure in IT infrastructure
- Evaluating the adequacy of IT controls relative to the risk profile
- Assessing vendor and third-party technology risks
- Reviewing IT project risks, including implementation and
  integration risks
- Evaluating emerging technology risks and their potential impact
- Documenting technology risk assessments and remediation plans
- Integrating technology risk into the overall operational risk
  management framework

The IT risk concept required under Principle 5 must be regularly reviewed
and updated to reflect changes in the technology landscape, threat
environment, and business activities.

12. PHYSICAL SECURITY

While not addressed as a standalone principle, physical security is
encompassed within the operational risk management framework as part
of the Basel event type "Damage to physical assets." Banks must:
- Protect physical premises housing critical IT infrastructure and
  data centres
- Implement access controls for sensitive areas
- Establish environmental controls (fire, flood, power) for critical
  facilities
- Include physical security threats in business continuity planning
- Ensure physical security measures are proportionate to the risks

13. EMPLOYEE RISK (FRAUD, ERRORS, AND MISCONDUCT)

Operational risks relating to employees are addressed under the Basel
event types "Internal fraud" and "Employment practices and workplace
safety." The circular requires banks to:
- Implement controls to prevent and detect internal fraud
- Establish clear codes of conduct and ethical standards
- Screen employees in sensitive positions
- Implement segregation of duties and dual-control principles
- Monitor employee activities where warranted by the risk profile
- Establish whistleblowing and incident reporting mechanisms
- Conduct investigations into suspected fraud or misconduct
- Address employee errors through process improvement and training

Under Appendix 3 Principle 5, employees handling CID must receive
specific training on data confidentiality obligations.

14. LEGAL RISK MANAGEMENT

Legal risk is explicitly included within the definition of operational
risk. Banks must:
- Identify and assess legal risks arising from their activities
- Ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations
- Monitor changes in the legal and regulatory environment
- Assess the adequacy of contractual arrangements
- Maintain provisions for legal risks as appropriate
- Report significant legal risks to the board of directors and
  senior management
- Include legal risks in the operational risk reporting framework

Risks arising from cross-border financial services (margin nos. 136.2-
136.5) require particular attention, including:
- Identification of jurisdictional risks
- Assessment of regulatory compliance risks in relevant jurisdictions
- Management of risks related to cross-border data flows
- Designation of external asset managers as "partners" requiring
  careful selection and instruction

15. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

15.1 Internal Reporting
Banks must establish internal reporting processes that provide the board
of directors and senior management with:
- Regular updates on the operational risk profile
- Reports on loss events and near-misses
- Key risk indicator (KRI) dashboards and trend analyses
- Status reports on risk mitigation measures
- Results of self-assessments and scenario analyses
- BCM testing results
- IT risk and cybersecurity status reports

Reporting frequency and granularity must be appropriate to the size
and complexity of the institution.

15.2 External Reporting to FINMA
Banks must report to FINMA:
- Significant operational risk events as required under FINMASA
- Cyber attacks of significance per FINMA Guidance 05/2020 and
  Art. 29(2) FINMASA
- Severe CID-related incidents as per Appendix 3 Principle 8
- Capital adequacy reports including operational risk capital
  requirements
- Information requested by FINMA in the course of supervisory
  activities

15.3 Auditing (Margin No. 139)
Audit firms are to audit compliance with the provisions of the circular
according to FINMA Circular 13/3 "Auditing" and capture the findings
of their audit procedures in the audit report.

16. INCIDENT MANAGEMENT AND ESCALATION

Banks must establish incident management processes that include:
- Clear definitions of operational risk incidents and severity levels
- Defined escalation paths depending on incident severity
- Rapid response procedures for critical incidents
- Root cause analysis for significant events
- Corrective action tracking and implementation
- Lessons learned processes to prevent recurrence
- Communication protocols for internal and external stakeholders

For CID-related incidents specifically, Appendix 3 Principle 8 requires:
- Pre-defined processes for swift reaction
- A clear communication strategy covering FINMA, law enforcement,
  and media
- Reporting of exceptions and incidents to top management
- Formal incident identification processes and reaction schemes

17. OPERATIONAL RISK CAPITAL CALCULATION (MARGIN NOS. 3-116)

17.1 General Provisions
The circular specifies three approaches for determining capital
requirements for operational risks, as set out in Articles 89-94 CAO.
Capital requirements apply to both expected and unexpected losses.

Every bank must have principles for allocating its business activities
to the standardised business lines listed in margin no. 23 and
Appendix 1.

17.2 Basic Indicator Approach (BIA) -- Art. 90 CAO
Under the Basic Indicator Approach:
- Capital requirement = 15% (alpha factor) x average positive annual
  gross income over the preceding three years
- Gross income (GI) is defined as net interest income plus net
  non-interest income
- Only years with positive GI are included in the average
- This is the simplest approach, available to all banks

FINMA may require individual increases of capital requirements if a
determination based exclusively on the BIA would lead to
inappropriately low capital requirements due to low earnings
indicators (GI).

17.3 Standardized Approach (SA) -- Art. 93 CAO
Under the Standardized Approach:
- The bank's activities are allocated to eight standardised business
  lines (as per margin no. 23 and Appendix 1):
    (1) Corporate Finance
    (2) Trading and Sales
    (3) Retail Banking
    (4) Commercial Banking
    (5) Payment and Settlement
    (6) Agency Services
    (7) Asset Management
    (8) Retail Brokerage
- For each business line and each of the three preceding years, an
  earnings indicator (GI) is determined and multiplied by the relevant
  beta factor:
    Corporate Finance:       18%
    Trading and Sales:       18%
    Retail Banking:          12%
    Commercial Banking:      15%
    Payment and Settlement:  18%
    Agency Services:         15%
    Asset Management:        12%
    Retail Brokerage:        12%
- The capital requirement is the three-year average of the sum of
  capital requirements across all business lines (negative contributions
  from individual business lines may offset positive contributions
  within a given year, but negative annual totals are set to zero)

Use of the Standardized Approach requires FINMA notification and
fulfilment of qualifying criteria, including adequate governance and
risk management systems.

17.4 Institution-Specific Approach / Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA)
The AMA allows banks to quantify capital requirements for operational
risk according to their own procedure, subject to FINMA approval and
stringent qualifying criteria:

- Internal measurement systems must be based on a minimum five-year
  observation period of internal loss data (three years upon initial
  implementation)
- Loss data must be systematically collected and mapped to business
  lines (margin no. 23) and event types (Appendix 2)
- The measurement system must incorporate internal loss data, relevant
  external loss data, scenario analyses, and business environment and
  internal control factors
- The system must capture the major drivers of risk affecting the
  shape of the tail of the loss distribution
- Risk mitigation through insurance may be recognised up to a maximum
  of 20% of the total operational risk capital requirement
- The AMA must be deeply embedded in the bank's risk management
  processes ("use test")
- Regular validation and back-testing of the model are required
- Independent review by internal audit

Floor requirement: For banks using the AMA, minimum capital requirements
at the overall bank level (taking into account deductions from eligible
capital) cannot be lower than 80% of the requirements under the
Basel I minimum standard.

17.5 Combined Use of Approaches
Banks may, with FINMA approval, use a combination of approaches
(partial use). For example, the AMA may be used for certain business
lines while the Standardized Approach is used for others, subject to
specific conditions and timelines for full implementation.

18. CATEGORY-SPECIFIC AND PROPORTIONALITY REQUIREMENTS

18.1 Principle of Proportionality (Margin Nos. 117-118)
The qualitative requirements described in Chapter IV are to be
implemented depending on the bank's size. Banks of supervisory
categories 4 and 5 are deemed "small banks." Margin no. 119 specifies
the margin numbers from which small banks shall be exempted.

18.2 Supervisory Categories and Differentiated Requirements
FINMA assigns supervised institutions to categories 1 through 5 based
on criteria including total assets, assets under management, privileged
deposits, and capital requirements:

  Category 1: Systemically important banks (e.g. UBS, Credit Suisse)
    - Full application of all provisions
    - Additional requirements for systemically important functions
    - Recovery and resolution planning requirements
    - Most stringent IT and cyber risk requirements

  Category 2: Large banks
    - Full application of all qualitative requirements
    - Comprehensive operational risk management infrastructure expected

  Category 3: Medium-sized banks
    - Full application of all qualitative requirements
    - Proportionate implementation expected

  Categories 4-5: Small banks
    - Exemption from certain margin numbers as specified in margin no. 119
    - Reduced reporting and documentation requirements
    - Simplified risk assessment processes permitted
    - Core risk management principles still apply

18.3 Risk-Specific Qualitative Requirements (Margin Nos. 137-138)
For specific operational risks "with wide-ranging implications," FINMA
expects enhanced management and control measures beyond the basic
qualitative requirements. Executive management must define and implement
additional, risk-specific measures or tighten existing measures on a
situational basis. This applies particularly to:
- IT and cyber risks of systemic significance
- Risks from concentration of outsourced services
- Cross-border operational risks
- Risks from handling mass client data

19. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER FINMA CIRCULARS AND REGULATIONS

FINMA Circular 2008/21 operates within a broader regulatory framework:
- FINMA Circular 2008/10 "Self-regulation as a minimum standard":
  Recognises SBA recommendations (including BCM) as minimum standards
- FINMA Circular 2017/1 "Corporate Governance -- Banks":
  Establishes governance requirements relevant to operational risk oversight
- FINMA Circular 2018/3 "Outsourcing -- Banks":
  Detailed requirements for outsourcing arrangements

  Cyber attack reporting obligations under Art. 29(2) FINMASA
- FINMA Circular 2008/24 "Supervision and internal control":
  Internal control system requirements complementing operational risk
  management

20. TRANSITION TO FINMA CIRCULAR 2023/1

FINMA completely revised Circular 2008/21 with the publication of
Circular 2023/1 "Operational Risks and Resilience -- Banks" on
7 December 2022 (effective 1 January 2024). Key changes include:

- Introduction of a new Chapter V on Operational Resilience, requiring
  institutions to define disruption tolerances for critical functions
  approved by the board of directors
- Enhanced ICT risk management requirements (Principle 2), aligned with
  BCBS papers on operational resilience and IT risk
- Expanded cyber risk management (Principle 3), including mandatory
  scenario analysis and enhanced testing requirements
- Critical data risk management (Principle 4) expanded beyond CID to
  cover all data of crucial significance regarding confidentiality,
  integrity, and availability
- BCM provisions (Principle 6) now directly regulated rather than
  relying on SBA minimum standards
- Capital requirements transferred to the revised CAO under Basel III
  implementation

Transition periods under Circular 2023/1:
- General requirements: two years from entry into force
- Inventory requirements: one year from entry into force

21. KEY DEFINITIONS

Operational Risk: The danger of losses occurring as a result of the
inadequacy or failure of internal processes, people, or systems, or as
a result of external events (Art. 89 CAO).

Client Identifying Data (CID): Electronic personal data of natural
persons (private clients) whose banking business is managed in or from
Switzerland.

Direct CID: All unique identifiers that allow the direct identification
of a client (names, signatures, email addresses, physical addresses).

Indirect CID: Information that identifies clients only when combined
with other data (passport numbers, account numbers, card numbers).

Potentially Indirect CID: Data enabling identification only with
additional context (birth dates, nationality, transaction data).

Small Banks: Banks of supervisory categories 4 and 5, eligible for
proportionate application of certain requirements.

Gross Income (GI): Net interest income plus net non-interest income,
used as the earnings indicator for BIA and SA capital calculations.

Risk Appetite: The deliberate acceptance of specific individual
operational risks with wide-ranging implications by the board of
directors.

Risk Tolerance: Quantitative and qualitative limits restricting
the risk appetite set by the board of directors.

Operational Risk with Wide-Ranging Implications: A risk that, if
materialised, could have significant impact on the institution's
financial position, reputation, or ability to continue operations.
