FINMA CIRCULAR 2008/21: OPERATIONAL RISKS -- BANKS
====================================================

1. OVERVIEW AND PURPOSE
FINMA Circular 2008/21 "Operational Risks -- Banks" is a key regulatory
instrument issued by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA).
It substantiates Articles 89-94 of the Capital Adequacy Ordinance (CAO/ERV)
and sets out qualitative requirements for managing operational risks and
quantitative requirements for determining operational risk capital.

The circular incorporates the BCBS "Principles for the Sound Management of
Operational Risk" (June 2011) as six thematic principles. It establishes that
responsibility for managing operational risks lies with top management and
requires systematic approaches, controls, reporting, and IT infrastructure
to identify, limit, and monitor these risks.

Originally issued 20 November 2008, partially revised effective 1 January 2015,
and last amended 31 October 2019. Superseded by FINMA Circular 2023/1
"Operational Risks and Resilience -- Banks" effective 1 January 2024.
Capital requirement provisions (margin nos. 3-116) continue to apply until
the CAO is revised under the final Basel III revision package.

2. LEGAL BASIS
- FINMASA, Art. 7 para. 1 let. b (authority to issue circulars)
- Banking Act (BankA), Art. 3 et seq.
- Banking Ordinance (BankO), Art. 12 (organizational requirements)
- Stock Exchange and Securities Trading Act (SESTA), Art. 19-20
- Capital Adequacy Ordinance (CAO/ERV), Art. 89-94 (operational risks)

3. SCOPE OF APPLICATION
The circular applies to banks licensed under the Banking Act, securities
dealers (now securities firms under FinIA), financial groups and
conglomerates, and Swiss branches of foreign banks.

Proportionality: Banks of supervisory categories 4 and 5 are deemed "small
banks" and exempted from certain provisions per margin no. 119. FINMA may
conduct institution-specific assessments to apply additional requirements
based on type, scope, complexity, and risks.

4. DEFINITION AND TAXONOMY OF OPERATIONAL RISKS
Per Art. 89 CAO, operational risk is "the danger of losses occurring as a
result of the inadequacy or failure of internal processes, people, or systems,
or as a result of external events." This encompasses legal risks, fraud
(internal/external), IT failures, business disruptions, employment practices
incidents, physical asset damage, process management failures, and client/
product/business practices failures. Strategic and reputational risk are
excluded for capital calculation but subject to general risk management.

4.1 Basel Event Type Categories (Appendix 2)
Loss events must be categorized per Appendix 2:
  (a) Internal fraud
  (b) External fraud
  (c) Employment practices and workplace safety
  (d) Clients, products, and business practices
  (e) Damage to physical assets
  (f) Business disruption and system failures
  (g) Execution, delivery, and process management

6. OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK

6.1 Principle 1: Responsibilities (Margin Nos. 121-124)
The board of directors must approve and regularly review the operational risk
framework, define risk appetite and tolerance, ensure senior management
implements policies effectively, and verify appropriate controls exist.
Risk appetite (deliberate acceptance of risks with wide-ranging implications)
must be restricted by tolerance limits.

Senior management must implement the framework, translate it into policies,
establish responsibility lines, allocate resources, and report regularly to
the board. An independent organisational unit for managing operational risks
shall be designated (margin no. 123) with responsibility for proactive
management and recommending actions to senior management (margin no. 124).

6.2 Principle 2: Framework and Control System (Margin Nos. 125-127)
Banks must establish and maintain a comprehensive operational risk management
framework (framework concept) that includes:
- Policies and procedures for identifying, assessing, monitoring, and
  controlling/mitigating operational risks
- A clearly defined governance structure with well-defined roles and
  responsibilities at all levels
- Risk assessment tools and methodologies
- Internal controls and compliance functions
- Integration of operational risk management into overall risk management
- Adequate documentation of all policies, processes, and procedures

The framework must be appropriate to the nature, scale, and complexity of
the bank's activities and subject to regular review. Specific operational
risks with far-reaching implications must be managed and controlled more
comprehensively than set out by basic qualitative requirements. Executive
management must situationally define additional risk-specific measures.

6.3 Principle 3: Identification, Mitigation and Monitoring (Margin Nos. 128-130)
Banks must systematically identify risks across all activities, assess impact
and likelihood, implement mitigation measures, continuously monitor exposures
and loss events, maintain risk databases, conduct self-assessments and scenario
analyses, and use key risk indicators (KRIs) for early warning. Methods for
allocating capital to major business lines must create incentives for improved
risk management.

6.4 Principle 4: Internal and External Reporting (Margin Nos. 131-134)
Reporting mechanisms must include regular internal reports to the board and
senior management, timely escalation of significant events, external reporting
to FINMA, trend analyses, and KRI dashboards. Scope and frequency must be
proportionate to the institution's size and complexity.

7. IT RISK MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS

7.1 Principle 5: Technological Infrastructure (Margin No. 135)
Banks must maintain IT infrastructure supporting identification, limitation,
and monitoring of operational risks. Requirements include an IT network
environment overview, systematic IT risk identification and assessment,
monitoring and mitigation measures, business disruption safeguards, IT
security measures, capacity planning, and regular system testing.

Banks must develop a concept covering: comprehensive IT environment mapping
(hardware, software, networks, data centres); IT asset classification by
criticality; systematic risk assessment including threats and vulnerabilities;
proportionate IT controls; operational and security event monitoring; and
incident detection and response capabilities.

7.2 Cybersecurity Requirements
The circular (amended 2017) requires specific cyber risk management:
- Concepts for identifying and responding to cyber attacks
- Cyber-attack identification and response protocols
- Regular testing of cyber defences
- Monitoring for cyber intrusions and anomalous behaviour
- Scenario analysis on cyber threats
- Cyber-specific incident response plans
FINMA Guidance 05/2020 specifies cyber attack reporting under Art. 29(2) FINMASA.

7.3 Change Management
IT change management must ensure changes are authorized, tested, and
documented; impact assessments precede implementation; rollback procedures
exist; production environments are protected; version control is maintained;
and post-implementation reviews are conducted.

8. DATA MANAGEMENT AND PROTECTION

8.1 Overview (Appendix 3)
Appendix 3 establishes nine principles for managing risks related to
confidentiality of electronic personal data of private clients managed
in/from Switzerland, focused on mass client data risks in electronic systems.

8.2 Categories of Client Identifying Data (CID)
(a) Direct CID: Unique identifiers for direct client identification (names,
    signatures, email/physical addresses, company identifiers)
(b) Indirect CID: Identifies clients only when combined with other data
    (passport/social security/account/card numbers, IP addresses)
(c) Potentially Indirect CID: Identification possible only with additional
    context (birth dates, nationality, professional qualifications, transactions)

8.3 Nine Principles for CID Protection (Appendix 3)
Principle 1 -- Governance: Systematically identify, limit, and monitor CID
confidentiality risks. Board supervises management; independent controlling
function established.

Principle 2 -- Data Inventory and Classification: Maintain CID inventory
classified by sensitivity. Document locations and map data flows.

Principle 3 -- Access Management: Role- and task-specific authorisation on
strict need-to-know basis. Enhanced controls for cross-functional and
cross-border access.

Principle 4 -- Infrastructure and Technology Security: Standards must reflect
bank complexity and risk. Protect CID at endpoints, during transfer, and in
storage. CID stored/accessed abroad requires anonymisation, encryption, or
pseudonymisation plus Data Protection Act compliance.

Principle 5 -- Employee Awareness and Training: Employees handling CID must
know confidentiality obligations. Regular training required.

Principle 6 -- Logging and Monitoring: Log and monitor CID access/processing.
Detect and investigate anomalous patterns and unauthorized transfers.

Principle 7 -- Outsourcing of CID Processing: Confidentiality as decisive
outsourcing criterion. Bank remains ultimately responsible for CID throughout
outsourced service lifecycle. Mandatory for all activities accessing mass CID
(IT services, platform maintenance, hosting). See FINMA Circular 2018/3.

Principle 8 -- Incident Management and Communication: Pre-defined swift
reaction processes. Communication strategy for FINMA, law enforcement, media.
Report exceptions and incidents to top management. Formalised identification
processes and reaction schemes.

Principle 9 -- Cross-Border Activity Risks: Manage risks from cross-border
CID transmission and storage, including jurisdictional data protection compliance.

9. BUSINESS CONTINUITY MANAGEMENT (BCM)

9.1 Principle 6: Business Continuity (Margin No. 136)
FINMA Circular 2008/10 recognises SBA BCM recommendations as minimum standard.
Where business disruption risk constitutes an "operational risk with wide-
ranging implications," further-reaching measures are expected. Banks must
maintain: Business Impact Analysis (BIA); Business Continuity Plans (BCP);
recovery strategies with defined RTO and RPO; regular testing against severe
but plausible scenarios; crisis management and communication plans; and
defined escalation procedures.

9.2 Disaster Recovery Planning
Banks must establish DRPs covering: critical IT systems identification;
RTO/RPO per critical system; alternative processing arrangements; regular
backup and restoration testing; documented recovery procedures; regular
DRP testing and updates; coordination with BCM planning.

10. OUTSOURCING OF OPERATIONAL FUNCTIONS
Governed jointly with FINMA Circular 2018/3 "Outsourcing -- Banks." Key
principles: bank retains ultimate responsibility; outsourcing requires risk
assessment; SLAs must cover operational risk management, reporting, and audit
rights; outsourced activities need internal controls; contingency plans for
critical outsourced services; due diligence with confidentiality as decisive
criterion for CID activities; ongoing monitoring required. For mass CID
access, Appendix 3 Principle 7 applies fully.

11. TECHNOLOGY RISK ASSESSMENT
Banks must regularly assess technology risks: identify dependencies across
business lines; assess single points of failure; evaluate IT control adequacy;
assess vendor/third-party technology risks; review IT project risks; evaluate
emerging technology risks; document assessments and remediation plans; integrate
technology risk into overall operational risk framework. The Principle 5 IT
risk concept must be regularly updated.

12. PHYSICAL SECURITY
Encompassed within the "Damage to physical assets" Basel event type. While
not addressed as a standalone principle, physical security is integral to
the operational risk management framework. Banks must:
- Protect physical premises housing critical IT infrastructure and
  data centres from unauthorised access
- Implement access controls for sensitive areas (server rooms, vaults,
  trading floors)
- Establish environmental controls (fire suppression, flood protection,
  uninterruptible power supply) for critical facilities
- Include physical security threats in business continuity planning
- Ensure physical security measures are proportionate to identified risks
- Regularly review the adequacy of physical security arrangements

13. EMPLOYEE RISK (FRAUD, ERRORS, MISCONDUCT)
Addressed under "Internal fraud" and "Employment practices" event types.
Banks must implement fraud prevention/detection controls; establish codes
of conduct; screen sensitive-position employees; implement segregation of
duties and dual-control; monitor employee activities by risk profile;
establish whistleblowing mechanisms; investigate suspected fraud; address
errors through process improvement and training. CID handlers require
specific confidentiality training per Appendix 3 Principle 5.

14. LEGAL RISK MANAGEMENT
Legal risk is within the operational risk definition. Banks must identify
and assess legal risks; ensure regulatory compliance; monitor legal/
regulatory changes; assess contractual adequacy; maintain legal provisions;
report significant legal risks; include in operational risk reporting.
Cross-border financial services (margin nos. 136.2-136.5) require particular
attention to jurisdictional risks and external asset manager designation.

15. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

15.1 Internal Reporting
Provide board and senior management with: operational risk profile updates;
loss event and near-miss reports; KRI dashboards and trends; mitigation
status reports; self-assessment and scenario results; BCM testing results;
IT risk and cybersecurity reports. Frequency proportionate to institution size.

15.2 External Reporting to FINMA
Report: significant operational risk events under FINMASA; significant cyber
attacks per Guidance 05/2020 and Art. 29(2) FINMASA; severe CID incidents per
Appendix 3 Principle 8; capital adequacy including operational risk capital;
information requested during supervisory activities.

15.3 Auditing (Margin No. 139)
Audit firms audit compliance per FINMA Circular 13/3 "Auditing."

16. INCIDENT MANAGEMENT AND ESCALATION
Banks must establish: incident definitions and severity levels; escalation
paths by severity; rapid response for critical incidents; root cause analysis;
corrective action tracking; lessons learned processes; communication protocols.
CID incidents require pre-defined swift reaction, FINMA/law enforcement/media
communication strategy, top management reporting, and formal reaction schemes.

17. OPERATIONAL RISK CAPITAL CALCULATION (MARGIN NOS. 3-116)

17.1 General Provisions
Three approaches per Art. 89-94 CAO. Capital covers expected and unexpected
losses. Banks must allocate activities to business lines per margin no. 23
and Appendix 1.

17.2 Basic Indicator Approach (BIA) -- Art. 90 CAO
Capital = 15% (alpha) x average positive annual gross income over three years.
GI = net interest income + net non-interest income. Only positive GI years
included. Available to all banks. FINMA may require increases if BIA yields
inappropriately low capital due to low GI.

17.3 Standardized Approach (SA) -- Art. 93 CAO
Activities allocated to eight business lines with beta factors:
  Corporate Finance: 18%    Trading and Sales: 18%
  Retail Banking: 12%       Commercial Banking: 15%
  Payment and Settlement: 18%  Agency Services: 15%
  Asset Management: 12%     Retail Brokerage: 12%
Capital = three-year average of summed business line requirements. Negative
business line contributions offset positives within a year; negative annual
totals set to zero. Requires FINMA notification and qualifying criteria.

17.4 Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA)
Banks quantify capital per own procedures, subject to FINMA approval:
- Minimum five-year internal loss data (three years initially)
- Loss data mapped to business lines and event types (Appendix 2)
- Must incorporate internal/external loss data, scenario analyses, business
  environment and internal control factors
- Must capture tail risk drivers
- Insurance mitigation recognised up to 20% of capital requirement
- Must be embedded in risk management ("use test")
- Regular validation, back-testing, and independent audit review
Floor: AMA capital cannot fall below 80% of Basel I minimum standard.

17.5 Combined Use
Banks may use approach combinations (partial use) with FINMA approval.

18. CATEGORY-SPECIFIC AND PROPORTIONALITY REQUIREMENTS

18.1 Proportionality (Margin Nos. 117-118)
Qualitative requirements scale by bank size. Categories 4-5 are "small banks"
with exemptions per margin no. 119.

18.2 Supervisory Categories
Category 1 (systemically important): Full provisions plus recovery/resolution
planning and most stringent IT/cyber requirements.
Category 2 (large): Full qualitative requirements, comprehensive infrastructure.
Category 3 (medium): Full qualitative requirements, proportionate implementation.
Categories 4-5 (small): Certain exemptions, reduced reporting, simplified
risk assessment, but core principles still apply.

18.3 Risk-Specific Requirements (Margin Nos. 137-138)
Enhanced measures required for operational risks with wide-ranging implications,
particularly IT/cyber risks, outsourcing concentration, cross-border risks,
and mass client data handling.

context (birth dates, nationality, transaction data).

Small Banks: Banks of supervisory categories 4 and 5, eligible for
proportionate application of certain requirements.

Gross Income (GI): Net interest income plus net non-interest income, used
as the earnings indicator for BIA and SA capital calculations.

Risk Appetite: The deliberate acceptance of specific individual operational
risks with wide-ranging implications by the board of directors.

Risk Tolerance: Quantitative and qualitative limits restricting the risk
appetite set by the board of directors.

Operational Risk with Wide-Ranging Implications: A risk that, if
materialised, could have significant impact on the institution's financial
position, reputation, or ability to continue operations.

22. ENFORCEMENT AND SANCTIONS
Non-compliance may result in: supervisory measures under FINMASA Art. 29-37
(remedy orders, activity restrictions, investigating agents, authorisation
revocation); capital add-ons; enhanced supervisory intensity; increased audit
requirements; publication of measures.
