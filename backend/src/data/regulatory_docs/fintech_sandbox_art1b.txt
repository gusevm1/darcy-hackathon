FINTECH SANDBOX — ART. 1b BANKING ACT (BankA)

1. LEGAL BASIS
Art. 1b of the Federal Act on Banks and Savings Banks (BankA, SR 952.0)
and Art. 6a-6e of the Banking Ordinance (BankO, SR 952.02) establish the
FinTech sandbox regime, allowing certain innovative financial service
providers to accept public deposits without a full banking license.

The FinTech sandbox was introduced on 1 January 2019 to lower market entry
barriers for innovative fintech companies. It provides a simplified
regulatory framework while maintaining adequate customer protection.

- Are not subject to individual prudential supervision requirements
