Swiss Financial License Documentation Requirements
Comprehensive Overview — February 2026

This document provides an exhaustive overview of the documentation required to apply for key Swiss
financial licenses regulated by FINMA (Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority) and Self-Regulatory
Organizations (SROs). The five license types covered are:

1. E-Money/FinTech License (Art. 1b Banking Act) — For accepting public deposits up to CHF 100 million
2. VASP (Virtual Asset Service Provider) — For crypto/blockchain businesses
3. SRO Membership — For financial intermediaries subject to AML requirements
4. Payment Systems Operator (FinfraG) — For financial market infrastructure
5. Securities Firm License (FinIA) — For securities dealing and trading activities


== 1. E-MONEY / FINTECH LICENSE (Art. 1b Banking Act) ==

Switzerland does not have a standalone e-money license. E-money activities are treated as
deposit-taking and require either a full Banking License or the lighter FinTech License under Article 1b
of the Banking Act. The FinTech license allows acceptance of public deposits up to CHF 100 million without
engaging in lending or interest margin business.

1.1 Key Requirements
