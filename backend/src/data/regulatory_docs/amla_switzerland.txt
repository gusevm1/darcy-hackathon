SWISS ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING ACT (AMLA)
Federal Act on Combating Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing
(Geldwaeschereigesetz, GwG) — SR 955.0

Last revised: Comprehensive overview incorporating amendments through 2025

================================================================================
1. PURPOSE AND SCOPE (Articles 1–3)
================================================================================

1.1 Purpose (Art. 1)

The Anti-Money Laundering Act (AMLA) is the cornerstone of Switzerland's framework
for preventing money laundering, terrorist financing, and — since the 2021 amendments —
the financing of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Its stated purpose
is to establish the due diligence obligations of financial intermediaries and to
regulate the supervision of compliance with those obligations.

AMLA does not itself create criminal offences for money laundering. Those are found
in Art. 305bis and Art. 305ter of the Swiss Criminal Code (CC). Rather, AMLA imposes
preventive, administrative obligations on financial intermediaries and establishes
the supervisory architecture through which those obligations are enforced.

1.2 Scope — Financial Intermediaries (Art. 2)

AMLA applies to "financial intermediaries," which it divides into two categories:

(a) Prudentially supervised entities (Art. 2 para. 2):
    - Banks under the Banking Act (BA)
    - Fund management companies and asset managers of collective investment
      schemes under the Collective Investment Schemes Act (CISA)
    - Insurance institutions under the Insurance Supervision Act (ISA)
    - Securities dealers (now "securities firms") under the Financial
      Institutions Act (FinIA)
    - DLT trading facilities under the Financial Market Infrastructure Act (FMIA)
    - Licensed FinTech companies under Art. 1b BA
    - Managers of collective assets and trustees under FinIA

(b) Non-prudentially supervised financial intermediaries (Art. 2 para. 3):
    Persons who on a professional basis accept, hold on deposit, or help to
    transfer or invest assets belonging to third parties. This catch-all
    provision captures a wide range of activities including:
    - Money transmission / payment services
    - Currency exchange (including crypto-to-fiat exchange)
    - Lending
    - Trading in securities or financial instruments for third-party accounts
    - Asset management
    - Investment advisory services involving a power of disposition

    The Federal Council specifies through ordinance (AMLO, SR 955.01) when
    an activity is carried out "on a professional basis" — generally when
    annual gross revenue exceeds CHF 50,000 or transaction volume exceeds
    CHF 2 million.

1.3 Dealers (Art. 2 para. 1bis)

Since the 2019 amendment, persons who trade in goods on a professional basis and
accept cash payments exceeding CHF 100,000 (per transaction or linked transactions)
are also subject to AMLA due diligence obligations.

1.4 Exclusion of Certain Activities

Certain activities are explicitly excluded from AMLA scope, including pure software
development, pure advisory services without disposition powers, and activities
already fully supervised under other legislation where the supervision is deemed
equivalent.

1.5 Application to Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs)

Switzerland does not have a standalone VASP licensing regime. Instead, VASPs are
captured under the existing AMLA framework as financial intermediaries under
Art. 2 para. 3. Specifically:

- Crypto exchanges (fiat-to-crypto and crypto-to-crypto) are financial intermediaries
- Crypto custody/wallet providers holding assets for clients are financial intermediaries
- Token issuers may be financial intermediaries depending on token classification
- DeFi protocol operators may be financial intermediaries if they exercise sufficient
  control over the protocol

FINMA has clarified through various guidance documents that the substance-over-form
principle applies: the economic function of the activity, not its technical
implementation, determines whether AMLA applies.

================================================================================
2. DUE DILIGENCE OBLIGATIONS (Articles 3–8)
================================================================================

2.1 Identification of the Contracting Partner (Art. 3)

Financial intermediaries must verify the identity of the contracting partner when:
- Establishing a business relationship
- Carrying out transactions exceeding CHF 25,000 (or CHF 5,000 in the case of
  money exchange, and CHF 1,000 for virtual asset transfers)
- There is suspicion of money laundering or terrorist financing
- Previously obtained identification data is doubtful

For natural persons: identification is based on an official identity document
(passport, identity card). The financial intermediary must record: name, date of
birth, nationality, residential address, and the identification document details.

For legal entities: identification is based on an extract from the commercial register
or equivalent document. The financial intermediary must additionally identify the
persons authorized to act on behalf of the entity and verify their authority.

For crypto/virtual asset businesses, FINMA and the SROs have clarified that video
identification and electronic identification procedures are permissible, subject to
specific requirements set out in AMLO-FINMA and respective SRO regulations.

2.2 Identification of the Beneficial Owner (Art. 4)

The financial intermediary must require the contracting partner to declare the
identity of the beneficial owner (BO) with due care. A beneficial owner declaration
must be obtained whenever:

- A business relationship is established
- The contracting partner is not the beneficial owner or there is doubt
- An operating or domiciliary company is involved
- A cash transaction exceeds CHF 25,000
- A virtual asset transfer exceeds CHF 1,000

For legal entities: the BO is the natural person who ultimately controls the entity,
typically through holding 25% or more of the capital or voting rights, or through
other means of control.

The financial intermediary may not merely accept the declaration at face value; it
must verify its plausibility based on available information.

2.3 Duty of Care in Asset Transfers (Art. 4a — "Travel Rule")

When transferring assets (including virtual assets) on behalf of a client, the
financial intermediary must provide the recipient's financial intermediary with:
- Name of the originator
- Account number (or wallet address) of the originator
- Address, date of birth, or national identification number of the originator

The receiving financial intermediary must verify whether the originator information
is complete. If information is missing or incomplete, the receiving intermediary
must request it, and if it is not provided, must refuse or return the transfer.

For virtual asset transfers, Art. 10 AMLO-FINMA provides specific implementation
rules, including the CHF 1,000 threshold above which full originator and beneficiary
information must accompany the transfer.

2.4 Renewed Due Diligence (Art. 5)

Financial intermediaries must repeat their due diligence procedures when:
- There are doubts about the identity of the contracting partner or beneficial owner
  during the course of the business relationship
- Transactions are inconsistent with the documented purpose of the business
  relationship or the economic background of the client
- A risk-relevant change occurs (e.g., change in beneficial ownership, change
  in client's risk profile, significant change in transaction patterns)

This provision creates an ongoing monitoring obligation that goes beyond the initial
onboarding process.

2.5 Duty to Keep Records (Art. 7)

Financial intermediaries must maintain the following records for at least 10 years
from the end of the business relationship or the completion of the transaction:

- Transaction documents sufficient to allow a knowledgeable third party to form
  a reliable opinion about the transactions and business relationships
- Due diligence records (identification documents, BO declarations, risk
  classifications, enhanced due diligence records)
- Correspondence and internal notes relating to AML compliance

Records must be kept in Switzerland or in a location accessible to Swiss supervisory
authorities. For crypto businesses, this includes blockchain transaction records,
wallet address mappings, and any off-chain transaction documentation.

2.6 Organizational Measures (Art. 8)

Financial intermediaries must take organizational measures necessary to prevent
money laundering and terrorist financing, including:

- Appointing a qualified AML compliance officer
- Establishing internal AML policies, procedures, and controls
- Providing regular AML training to relevant staff
- Implementing a risk-based approach to client relationships
- Maintaining an internal reporting system
- Conducting regular internal reviews and audits

For higher-risk businesses (including many crypto businesses), FINMA and SROs
expect more extensive organizational measures, including dedicated compliance
teams, automated transaction monitoring systems, and enhanced governance.

================================================================================
3. REPORTING AND ASSET FREEZING (Articles 9–10)
================================================================================

3.1 Duty to Report (Art. 9)

A financial intermediary must immediately file a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR)
with the Money Laundering Reporting Office Switzerland (MROS) when it:

- Knows or has reasonable suspicion that assets involved in the business
  relationship are connected to a criminal offence under Art. 260ter (criminal
  organization) or Art. 305bis CC (money laundering)
- Knows or has reasonable suspicion that assets are subject to the power of
  disposal of a criminal organization
- Knows or has reasonable suspicion that assets serve the financing of terrorism
  (Art. 260quinquies CC)

The report must include all relevant information available to the financial
intermediary. After filing the SAR, the financial intermediary must follow the
instructions of MROS and may not inform the client or any third party about the
report ("tipping-off" prohibition).

MROS analyses the report and, if it deems the suspicion well-founded, forwards
it to the relevant prosecution authority. Approximately 60-70% of SARs are
forwarded in practice.

3.2 Right to Report (Art. 305ter para. 2 CC)

In addition to the mandatory reporting duty under Art. 9, Art. 305ter para. 2 of
the Criminal Code provides a right to report: financial intermediaries may report
observations that indicate assets are of criminal origin even if the threshold for
mandatory reporting is not yet met. This right-to-report mechanism is intended to
encourage proactive cooperation with authorities.

3.3 Asset Freezing (Art. 10)

Upon filing a SAR, the financial intermediary must immediately freeze the assets
that are the subject of the report. The freeze applies for a maximum of five
business days. Within that period, MROS must inform the financial intermediary
either:
- That the case has been forwarded to prosecution (in which case the freeze
  continues until a judicial order is issued), or
- That the case has been closed (in which case the freeze must be lifted)

If the financial intermediary terminates the business relationship instead of
filing a SAR, it must freeze the assets for five business days and inform MROS.

================================================================================
4. SUPERVISORY FRAMEWORK (Articles 12–18)
================================================================================

4.1 Two-Track Supervision Model

AMLA establishes a two-track supervisory model for non-prudentially supervised
financial intermediaries:

(a) SRO membership (Art. 14): Financial intermediaries under Art. 2 para. 3 must
    affiliate with a recognized self-regulatory organization (SRO). The SRO
    supervises compliance with AMLA due diligence obligations on behalf of FINMA.

(b) Direct FINMA supervision (Art. 14a): As an alternative to SRO membership,
    financial intermediaries may apply for direct supervision by FINMA. This
    option, introduced in the 2019 reform (effective January 1, 2020), is
    intended primarily for larger, more complex intermediaries and certain
    FinTech businesses.

4.2 Self-Regulatory Organizations (Art. 14)

SROs are private-law organizations recognized by FINMA to supervise financial
intermediaries' compliance with AMLA. They must:

- Issue their own regulations specifying AMLA due diligence obligations
  (subject to FINMA approval)
- Monitor their members' compliance through regular audits
- Impose sanctions on non-compliant members
- Report serious violations to FINMA

Recognized SROs include: VQF (Verein zur Qualitaetssicherung von
Finanzdienstleistungen), PolyReg, SO-FIT (formerly OAR-G), and several
sector-specific SROs.

4.3 FINMA Direct Supervision (Art. 14a)

Financial intermediaries directly supervised by FINMA (DSFI) are subject to:
- AMLO-FINMA (Anti-Money Laundering Ordinance FINMA)
- Direct FINMA inspections
- Mandatory external AML audits
- FINMA reporting requirements

This path is more resource-intensive but may be preferred by larger entities
that want a direct relationship with the regulator.

================================================================================
5. CRIMINAL PROVISIONS
================================================================================

5.1 Criminal Code Provisions

The primary criminal offences related to money laundering are in the Criminal Code:

- Art. 305bis CC — Money laundering: Anyone who carries out an act that is
  calculated to frustrate the identification of the origin, the tracing, or
  the forfeiture of assets which he knows or must assume to originate from
  a felony or from a qualified tax misdemeanor, is punishable by imprisonment
  of up to 3 years or a monetary penalty. In serious cases (professional
  activity, large amounts, criminal organization involvement), imprisonment
  of up to 5 years.

- Art. 305ter CC — Insufficient diligence in financial transactions: Anyone who
  on a professional basis accepts, holds on deposit, helps to invest, or
  helps to transfer assets belonging to another person, and fails to verify
  the identity of the beneficial owner with the diligence required by the
  circumstances, is punishable by imprisonment of up to 1 year or a monetary
  penalty.

5.2 AMLA Administrative Penalties

FINMA has a range of enforcement tools for AMLA violations:
- Orders to remedy deficiencies
- Appointment of an investigating agent
- Revocation of license or SRO recognition
- Publication of enforcement decisions (naming and shaming)
- Disgorgement of profits
- Industry bans for responsible individuals (up to 5 years)

================================================================================
6. RECENT AMENDMENTS RELATED TO CRYPTO AND VIRTUAL ASSETS
================================================================================

6.1 DLT Act (2021)

The Federal Act on the Adaptation of Federal Law to Developments in Distributed
Ledger Technology (DLT Act), which entered into force on August 1, 2021, brought
several changes relevant to AMLA:

- Introduction of DLT securities (Art. 973d et seq. CO)
- Creation of the DLT trading facility license under FMIA
- Explicit inclusion of DLT trading facilities in the Art. 2 para. 2 list
- Clarification that AMLA applies to all financial intermediaries regardless of
  the technology used

6.2 AMLA Reform (2023)

The revised AMLA provisions tightened requirements for:
- Beneficial owner transparency
- Adviser due diligence obligations
- Cross-border transaction monitoring
- Enhanced due diligence for virtual asset transactions

6.3 Travel Rule Implementation

FINMA clarified through revised AMLO-FINMA that the travel rule applies to all
virtual asset transfers and that financial intermediaries must ensure originator
and beneficiary information accompanies transfers above CHF 1,000.

6.4 Ongoing Consultation (2024–2025)

The Federal Council has continued to refine the AMLA framework to align with
evolving FATF standards, including:
- Expanded definition of virtual assets to cover certain DeFi activities
- Clarification of obligations for staking and lending platforms
- Requirements for unhosted wallet risk management

================================================================================
7. APPLICATION TO VIRTUAL ASSET SERVICE PROVIDERS (VASPs)
================================================================================

7.1 FINMA's Approach

FINMA applies a technology-neutral, substance-over-form approach. Any person or
entity that, on a professional basis, provides services that fall within Art. 2
para. 3 AMLA — regardless of whether those services are provided through
traditional or blockchain-based technology — is a financial intermediary subject
to AMLA.

7.2 Specific VASP Activities and Their AMLA Classification

Exchange services (fiat-to-crypto, crypto-to-fiat, crypto-to-crypto):
Financial intermediary under Art. 2 para. 3. SRO membership or FINMA direct
supervision required.

Custody/wallet services (holding private keys for clients):
Financial intermediary under Art. 2 para. 3 (holding assets on deposit). SRO
membership or FINMA direct supervision required. Depending on scale, may require
FinTech license or banking license.

Token issuance (ICO/ITO/STO):
The issuer may be a financial intermediary if the token constitutes a payment
token or if the issuer provides ongoing financial intermediary services.
Utility tokens generally do not trigger AMLA obligations unless they have a
payment function.

Transfer services:
Any service that facilitates the transfer of virtual assets between parties is
a financial intermediary.

DeFi protocols:
Where a natural or legal person exercises sufficient control over a DeFi protocol
(e.g., controls smart contracts, has admin keys, earns fees from protocol
operation), that person may be classified as a financial intermediary. Fully
decentralized, permissionless protocols without identifiable operators remain
in a regulatory grey zone, though FINMA has signaled a willingness to extend
regulation to protocol operators.

7.3 Practical Implications for Crypto Businesses

Crypto businesses operating in or from Switzerland must:
1. Determine whether their activities constitute financial intermediation
2. If yes, affiliate with an SRO (VQF and PolyReg are the most crypto-friendly)
   or apply for FINMA direct supervision
3. Implement full AMLA due diligence procedures
4. Establish a compliant AML framework (policies, compliance officer, training,
   transaction monitoring, record-keeping)
5. Comply with travel rule requirements for virtual asset transfers
6. File SARs with MROS as required
7. Depending on scale and activities, obtain additional FINMA licenses (FinTech
   license, banking license, DLT trading facility license, etc.)

================================================================================
8. KEY DEFINITIONS AND THRESHOLDS
================================================================================

- Business relationship: Any ongoing professional relationship with a financial
  intermediary for the provision of financial services
- Occasional transaction: A transaction carried out outside an established
  business relationship
- Identification threshold (general): CHF 25,000 for occasional transactions
- Identification threshold (money exchange): CHF 5,000
- Identification threshold (virtual asset transfers): CHF 1,000
- Cash payment threshold (dealers): CHF 100,000
- Record retention period: 10 years
- Asset freeze period: 5 business days (pending MROS decision)
