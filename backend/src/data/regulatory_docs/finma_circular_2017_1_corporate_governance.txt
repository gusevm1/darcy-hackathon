================================================================================

Document:       FINMA Circular 2017/1 "Corporate Governance -- Banks"
Issuer:         Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA)
Date of Issue:  1 November 2016
Entry into Force: 1 July 2017
Last Amendment: 4 November 2020 (effective 1 January 2021)
Replaces:       FINMA Circular 2008/24 "Supervision and Internal Control -- Banks"
Languages:      German (binding), French, Italian, English (unofficial)

================================================================================
I. PURPOSE, SCOPE, AND LEGAL BASIS
================================================================================

FINMA Circular 2017/1 establishes supervisory requirements for corporate
governance, risk management, the internal control system (ICS), and internal
audit at Swiss banks and securities dealers (Rz 1). It consolidates Circular
2008/24, its FAQs, and governance provisions from other circulars into one
instrument, incorporating the BCBS Guidelines on Corporate Governance (2015).

Legal basis:
- Art. 3 para. 2 let. a Banking Act (BA): Proper organization
- Art. 3 para. 2 let. a Banking Ordinance (BO): Organizational rules
- Art. 10 para. 2 let. d Stock Exchange Act (SESTA): Securities dealers
- Art. 7 para. 3 FINMASA: Authorization of circulars
- Art. 3f BA: Internal audit; Art. 3c BA: Groups and conglomerates

The circular applies to (Rz 1-5): banks licensed under Art. 3 BA, securities
dealers under SESTA, financial groups (Art. 3c para. 1 BA), and financial
conglomerates dominated by banks or securities dealers (Art. 3c para. 2 BA).

Proportionality (Rz 6-8): All requirements are implemented case-by-case,
giving due consideration to size, complexity, structure, and risk profile.
FINMA retains discretion to grant reliefs or impose stricter conditions.

================================================================================
II. CATEGORY-SPECIFIC PROPORTIONALITY
================================================================================

FINMA classifies institutions into five supervisory categories (Rz 6-8):

Category 1 -- Systemically important banks (G-SIBs, D-SIBs):
  Separate audit and risk committees; nomination and compensation committees
  at group level; CRO as executive management member; enhanced risk data
  aggregation and reporting.

Category 2 -- Large banks:
  Separate audit and risk committees; CRO required; enhanced requirements.

Category 3 -- Medium-sized banks:
  Audit and risk committees required but may be combined; CRO required.

Category 4 -- Smaller banks:
  Baseline requirements only; no mandatory committees.

Category 5 -- Smallest banks:
  Baseline requirements only; simplified governance permitted.

FINMA may deviate from category-based requirements in individual cases.

================================================================================
III. BOARD OF DIRECTORS (GOVERNING BODY)
================================================================================

The institution must maintain an effective ICS proportionate to its size,
complexity, structure, and risk profile (Rz 60). Minimum two controlling
levels: revenue-generating units and independent control bodies (Rz 61).

B. Three Lines of Defense Model (Rz 63-66)

First Line -- Revenue-Generating Units (Rz 63): primary responsibility for
risk identification, assessment, and management; implementation of internal
controls in daily operations; adherence to risk limits and policies.

generating units; must cover at minimum risk control and compliance functions;
monitor risks and statutory/regulatory/internal compliance; provide oversight,
frameworks, and independent challenge to first line.

Third Line -- Internal Audit (Rz 66): organizationally separate from first
and second lines; independent objective assurance to governing body; reviews
effectiveness of risk management, controls, and governance; reports directly

================================================================================
IX. RISK MANAGEMENT FUNCTION (Rz 67-76)
================================================================================

Organization (Rz 67-70): Categories 1-3 must appoint an independent risk
control function. CRO required for Categories 1-3; for systemically important
institutions, CRO must be an executive management member. The CRO may also
oversee other non-revenue-generating control functions (e.g., compliance).
CRO must have direct access to the governing body and risk committee.

Responsibilities (Rz 71-74):
- Systematic monitoring of individual and aggregated risk exposures (Rz 71)
- Quantitative/qualitative risk analyses, stress tests, scenario analyses
  under adverse conditions (Rz 72)
- Regular reporting to management (semi-annually) and governing body
  (annually); timely notification of special developments (Rz 73)
- Support development of the risk framework concept (Rz 74)

Reporting (Rz 75-76): semi-annual to management body; annual to governing
body; immediate notification of material developments; in critical situations,
direct reporting to governing body without delay. Risk committee receives
regular CRO reports on risk framework compliance.

================================================================================
X. COMPLIANCE FUNCTION (Rz 77-82)
================================================================================

Organization (Rz 77-79): institutions must establish a compliance function.
Categories 1-3 must appoint an independent compliance function as an
independent control body. CCO must have appropriate authority, resources, and
information access. CCO may report to the CRO if the CRO assumes combined
control function responsibilities.

Responsibilities (Rz 80-82):
- Regulatory monitoring: track changes in laws, regulations, and expectations;
  assess impact; advise management (Rz 80)
- Compliance risk management: identify and assess compliance risks; develop
  policies and procedures; monitor adherence (Rz 81)
- Reporting: report to audit committee at least every six months on progress
  eliminating shortcomings and implementing internal/external audit

XI. INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION (Rz 83-95)
================================================================================

A. Organization and Independence (Rz 83-86)

Internal audit must be organizationally separate from both first and second
lines (Rz 83). Reports directly to the governing body or audit committee
(Rz 84). The governing body appoints/dismisses the head of internal audit,
approves the charter and audit plan, and ensures adequate resources (Rz 85).
Internal audit must be free from management influence; staff must not engage
in operational activities; head of internal audit has unrestricted access to
the governing body and audit committee chairs (Rz 86).

B. Responsibilities (Rz 87-90)

- Assurance: independent review of risk management, internal control
  effectiveness, governance, and second-line functions (Rz 87)
- Planning: risk-based audit planning; comprehensive multi-year coverage;
  coordination with regulatory auditor (Rz 88)
- Reporting: at least annually to governing body, management body, and
  regulatory audit firm; issue audit reports with recommendations (Rz 89)
- Special investigations: upon request of the governing body (Rz 90)

C. Delegation of Internal Audit (Rz 91-95)

Internal audit may be delegated to (Rz 92-94):
a) Parent/group company if regulated (bank, securities dealer, insurer)
b) Independent second audit firm (separate from regulatory auditor)
c) Unregulated group company or independent third party -- a notable
   expansion, subject to auditor confirmation of professional capabilities
   and adequate technical/human resources

Conditions (Rz 95): governing body retains overall responsibility; delegate
must meet professional and resource requirements; regulatory auditor confirms
capabilities; FINMA must be notified or approve the arrangement.

================================================================================
XII. OUTSOURCING GOVERNANCE (Rz 96-97)
================================================================================

Outsourcing does not relieve the governing or management body of their
responsibilities (Rz 96). Key governance requirements (Rz 97):
- Governing body approval for outsourcing material functions
- Adequate oversight and monitoring of outsourced activities
- Clear SLAs defining responsibilities, performance, and reporting
- Retained expertise to oversee outsourced functions
- Business continuity and exit strategies

Detailed outsourcing rules: FINMA Circular 2018/3 "Outsourcing -- Banks
and Insurers" (effective 1 April 2018).

================================================================================
XIII. INFORMATION AND REPORTING FLOWS
================================================================================

The circular prescribes structured reporting flows (Rz 73, 75-76, 82, 89):

To the Governing Body: annual risk control report; annual internal audit
report; semi-annual compliance progress (via audit committee); immediate
notification of critical developments.

To the Management Body: semi-annual risk control reports; timely notification
of special developments; internal audit findings.

To the Audit Committee: semi-annual remediation progress reports from
compliance/risk control; internal and external audit reports.

To the Risk Committee: regular CRO reports on risk framework; stress test
results; risk limit utilization.

Escalation: risk control and compliance may bypass management and report
directly to the governing body in important cases. Internal audit has direct
access to the governing body at all times.

================================================================================
XIV. FIT AND PROPER REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================

Governing body (Rz 23-25): individual -- good reputation, adequate
qualifications, sufficient time; collective -- expertise in banking, risk
management, accounting, strategy, and law. Ongoing reassessment required.

Executive management (Rz 46, 52): professional qualifications, experience,
and personal integrity for proper conduct of business.

Key function holders (Rz 67-68, 79): CRO and CCO must possess specific
expertise relevant to their function with appropriate standing and authority.

================================================================================
XV. CONFLICT OF INTEREST MANAGEMENT (Rz 29-30)
================================================================================

The governing body defines how conflicts of interest are identified,
disclosed, managed, and avoided (Rz 29). All current and previous conflicts
must be disclosed -- including financial interests, business relationships,
personal connections, external mandates, and shareholdings.

If a conflict cannot be avoided (Rz 30), the institution takes appropriate
steps: recusal from conflicted decisions; information barriers; independent
review; documentation. Organizational measures include policies on external
mandates, personal account dealing, and related party transactions.

================================================================================
XVI. FINANCIAL GROUPS AND CONGLOMERATES (Rz 98-100)
================================================================================

Circular provisions apply by analogy to financial groups and bank-dominated
conglomerates (Rz 98). Group standards must ensure efficient and uniform
management, appropriate information exchange, defined duties and independence
at each management level, and group-wide risk management and ICS frameworks
(Rz 99-100). The parent governing body bears responsibility for group-level
governance.

================================================================================
XVII. TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS (Rz 101-106)
================================================================================

- Entry into force: 1 July 2017 (Rz 101)
- General transition: most requirements within one year (by 1 July 2018)
  (Rz 102)
- Categories 1-3 enhanced: one-year implementation from entry into force
  for mandatory committees, CRO, and risk data aggregation (Rz 103-104)
- Systemically relevant banks: comply from entry into force or within three
  years of classification, whichever is later (Rz 105)
- New entrants: higher-category requirements within reasonable FINMA-
  determined timeframe (Rz 106)
