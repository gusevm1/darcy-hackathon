ESISUISSE — SWISS DEPOSITOR PROTECTION SCHEME
==============================================
Comprehensive Knowledge Base Document
Last updated: 2025


1. OVERVIEW OF SWISS DEPOSITOR PROTECTION
------------------------------------------

Swiss depositor protection is governed by Articles 37a through 37jbis of
the Federal Act on Banks and Savings Banks (Banking Act, BankA; SR 952.0),
together with Articles 42a through 44a of the Banking Ordinance (BankO;
SR 952.02). The scheme protects deposits held at banks and securities firms
licensed by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA).

The Swiss depositor protection framework rests on three pillars:

(a) Bankruptcy privilege (Konkursprivileg): Privileged deposits enjoy
    preferential treatment in bankruptcy proceedings, meaning they are
    satisfied before ordinary unsecured claims (Art. 37a BankA).

(b) Immediate payout mechanism (Sofortauszahlung): Protected deposits are
    paid out from the insolvent bank's available liquid assets at the
    outset of bankruptcy proceedings, outside the normal schedule of claims
    (Art. 37b BankA).

(c) Deposit insurance (Einlagensicherung): If the insolvent bank's liquid
    assets are insufficient to cover the full payout of protected deposits,
    the deposit insurance body — esisuisse — steps in to fund the shortfall
    (Art. 37h BankA).

The Swiss system is distinctive in several respects. It combines statutory
provisions in the Banking Act with self-regulation by esisuisse, uses an
ex-post funding model rather than a pre-funded deposit insurance fund, and
requires banks to maintain a domestic asset coverage ratio of 125% of
privileged deposits.


2. ESISUISSE AS THE DEPOSIT INSURANCE BODY
--------------------------------------------

esisuisse (formally: Einlagensicherung der Schweizer Banken und
Effektenhändler) is the deposit insurance body for Switzerland. It is
organized as a private-law association (Verein) under Swiss law, domiciled
in Basel. esisuisse was established in 2005 and operates under the
self-regulation framework recognized by FINMA pursuant to Art. 37h BankA.

Key organizational facts:

- Legal form: Association under Art. 60 et seq. Swiss Civil Code (ZGB)
- Domicile: Basel, Switzerland
- Governing documents: Statutes (version 23.12.2022), Self-Regulation
  Agreement (version 23.12.2022)
- Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with FINMA for coordination and
  information exchange
- Member of the International Association of Deposit Insurers (IADI)

As of 31 December 2024, esisuisse comprises 256 members:
- 232 active banks
- 19 active securities firms (account-holding)
- 5 institutes in wind-down operations

esisuisse performs the following core functions:
- Administering the deposit insurance scheme
- Collecting and managing member data on protected and privileged deposits
- Coordinating with FINMA and bank liquidators in the event of insolvency
- Transferring funds to the liquidator for payout to depositors
- Recovering disbursed amounts through the bankruptcy dividend
- Issuing self-regulation documents and client information templates
- Publishing annual reports and deposit statistics


3. MEMBERSHIP REQUIREMENTS
----------------------------

Membership in esisuisse is mandatory for all institutions that accept
protected deposits, as stipulated in Art. 37h para. 3 BankA.

The following institutions must be members:

(a) All banks licensed by FINMA under Art. 1 BankA, including:
    - Universal banks
    - Private banks

    - PostFinance
    - Foreign bank branches authorized by FINMA

(b) Account-holding securities firms licensed under the Financial
    Institutions Act (FinIA; SR 954.1) that accept client deposits.

The following are NOT required to be members:
- Non-account-holding securities firms
- FinTech license holders under Art. 1b BankA (sandbox or innovation
  license entities)

- Reporting of deposit data to esisuisse (annual data submission)
- Maintaining the required collateral for payment obligations
- Making contributions upon call by esisuisse in an insolvency event
- Displaying standardized client information about deposit insurance
  on websites and in client documentation


4. PROTECTED DEPOSIT CATEGORIES
---------------------------------

The following deposit categories are protected by the deposit insurance
scheme (Art. 37a para. 1 BankA, as amended effective 1 January 2023):

4.1 Deposits Covered by Deposit Insurance (Protected Deposits)

(a) Credit balances in government-issued currencies (CHF, EUR, USD, etc.)
    on accounts held in the client's name, including:
    - Savings accounts
    - Current accounts (Kontokorrent)
    - Investment accounts
    - Salary accounts
    - Youth and student accounts

(b) Overnight deposits, fixed-term deposits, and time deposits

(c) Credit balances on metal accounts (gold, silver, platinum, palladium)
    where the contract provides for repayment in a government-issued
    currency

(d) Medium-term notes (Kassenobligationen) issued by the bank, provided:
    - They are denominated in a government-issued currency
    - They are deposited in custody with the issuing bank
    - They are held in the name of the bearer/depositor

(e) Deposits in foreign government-issued currencies, converted at the
    exchange rate prevailing on the date bankruptcy proceedings commence

4.2 Deposits Not Covered by Deposit Insurance (Exclusions)

The following are NOT protected by deposit insurance:

(a) Deposits exceeding CHF 100,000 per client per bank (the excess
    portion falls into the third creditor class)

(b) Securities held in custody accounts (these are client property and
    are segregated and returned in bankruptcy — not deposits)

(c) Cryptocurrency units held in custody accounts

(d) Contents of safe deposit boxes

(e) Bonds and other debt securities (unless qualifying as medium-term
    notes deposited with the issuing bank)

(f) Credit balances not denominated in a government-issued currency

(g) Deposits at institutions not authorized by FINMA

(h) Assets held through insurance wrappers, structured products, or
    derivatives

(i) Dormant assets (assets whose owner has had no contact with the bank
    for an extended period and cannot be located)

(j) As of 1 January 2023: deposits by financial intermediaries (banks,
    securities firms, insurance companies) — these are no longer protected

(k) Deposits at fintech license holders (Art. 1b BankA) and sandbox
    entities (Art. 6 para. 2 BankO)


5. CHF 100,000 PER DEPOSITOR PER BANK GUARANTEE
--------------------------------------------------

The maximum deposit insurance coverage is CHF 100,000 per depositor
(client) per bank (Art. 37a para. 1 BankA).

Key rules governing this limit:

(a) All accounts held by the same client at the same bank are aggregated
    toward the CHF 100,000 limit. This includes savings accounts, current
    accounts, time deposits, and qualifying medium-term notes.

(b) Each bank is treated as a separate entity. A depositor with accounts
    at multiple banks receives CHF 100,000 protection at each bank.

(c) For Raiffeisen: Each Raiffeisen cooperative is treated as a separate,
    independent bank. The CHF 100,000 limit applies independently to each
    cooperative. Branches and subsidiaries of a single cooperative are NOT
    treated as separate entities.

(d) Accrued interest credited to the client's account is included in the
    protected amount. Interest that has accrued but not yet been booked,
    and expired fees or charges, are excluded.

(e) The Federal Council may adjust the CHF 100,000 limit if its real
    value is significantly eroded by inflation (Art. 37a para. 7 BankA).

(f) Deposits in foreign currencies are converted to CHF at the exchange
    rate prevailing on the date bankruptcy proceedings are opened. The
    CHF 100,000 limit applies to the converted amount.


6. PRIVILEGED DEPOSITS IN BANKRUPTCY (Art. 37a BankA)
------------------------------------------------------

The bankruptcy privilege (Konkursprivileg) grants preferential treatment
to certain deposits in bank insolvency proceedings. Privileged deposits
are satisfied in the second creditor class, ahead of ordinary unsecured
claims (third class).

The creditor hierarchy in Swiss bank bankruptcy is:

First class (Art. 219 SchKG):
- Employee salary claims and related social insurance contributions

Second class (Art. 37a BankA):
- Protected deposits (up to CHF 100,000 per depositor per bank)
- Preferential deposits at foreign branches of Swiss banks (up to
  CHF 100,000, but NOT covered by deposit insurance)
- Vested benefits deposits (Freizügigkeitsguthaben) up to CHF 100,000
  per client and foundation
- Pillar 3a pension deposits (Säule 3a) up to CHF 100,000 per client
  and foundation
- Claims of esisuisse for amounts disbursed under the deposit insurance
  scheme (subrogation)

Third class:
- All other unsecured claims, including:
  - Deposit amounts exceeding CHF 100,000
  - Claims by financial intermediaries (since 1 January 2023)
  - Ordinary trade creditors

If available funds are insufficient to satisfy all creditors within a
class, they receive pro-rata distributions (bankruptcy dividend).

The 125% asset coverage requirement (Art. 37a para. 5 BankA) mandates
that banks must at all times hold assets located in Switzerland equal to
at least 125% of their total privileged deposits (protected deposits plus
preferential deposits). This backing requirement is designed to ensure
that in bankruptcy, sufficient domestically located assets exist to cover
the privileged claims.


7. IMMEDIATE PAYOUT MECHANISM
-------------------------------

The immediate payout mechanism (Sofortauszahlung) is a key feature of
the Swiss system, established in Art. 37b BankA. It ensures that
protected deposits are disbursed at the outset of bankruptcy proceedings,
outside the ordinary schedule of claims.

The mechanism operates as follows:

Step 1: FINMA opens bankruptcy proceedings against the bank and appoints
a liquidator (Art. 33 et seq. BankA).

Step 2: The liquidator identifies all depositors with protected deposits
and contacts them to provide payout instruction forms.

Step 3: The liquidator uses the bank's available liquid assets to pay out
protected deposits. These payments are made outside the ordinary schedule
of claims (i.e., they are not subject to the normal bankruptcy procedure
timeline).

Step 4: If the bank's available liquidity is insufficient to cover all
protected deposits, the liquidator notifies esisuisse.

Step 5: esisuisse calls on its member banks for contributions and
transfers the necessary funds to the liquidator within seven working days
(as of 1 January 2023; previously 20 working days).

Step 6: The liquidator disburses the esisuisse-funded amounts to the
remaining depositors.

Step 7: esisuisse is subrogated to the depositors' claims in the second
creditor class and recovers the amounts it disbursed through the
bankruptcy dividend.

Important constraints:
- Banks may NOT offset client debts (including mortgages) against
  protected deposits. The depositor receives the full protected amount,
  and the bank's counterclaims remain as separate receivables in the
  bankruptcy estate.
- All banking services cease immediately upon opening of bankruptcy
  (transfers, e-banking, cards, standing orders).
- Incoming transfers to the bankrupt institution are automatically
  returned to the sender.


8. CONTRIBUTION CALCULATION METHODOLOGY
-----------------------------------------

esisuisse operates on an ex-post funding model. Member banks do not make
regular contributions into a standing fund. Instead, contributions are
called when an insolvency event requires esisuisse to supplement the
bankrupt institution's liquid assets.

8.1 System Limit Calculation

The total payment obligation of all member banks is set at 1.6% of all
protected deposits in Switzerland (Art. 37h para. 3bis BankA). Based on
the latest reported data:

- Protected deposits as of 31.12.2024: CHF 497.4 billion
- System limit (1.6%): approximately CHF 7.96 billion
- Protected deposits as of 31.12.2023: CHF 496.5 billion
- System limit (1.6%): approximately CHF 7.94 billion

The Federal Council may increase this percentage if necessary.

8.2 Individual Bank Contribution Calculation

Each member bank's share of the total payment obligation is calculated
based on its proportion of total protected deposits relative to the
aggregate protected deposits of all member banks. The formula is:

  Individual payment obligation =
    (Bank's protected deposits / Total protected deposits of all members)
    x Total system payment obligation

Example: If a bank holds CHF 5 billion in protected deposits and total
protected deposits across all members are CHF 497.4 billion, the bank's
share = (5 / 497.4) x 7.96 billion = approximately CHF 80 million.

8.3 Individual Bank Contribution Cap

Each member bank's individual contribution is capped at 50% of its
required minimum capital (Art. 37h para. 3ter BankA). If a bank's
calculated share exceeds this cap, the excess is redistributed
proportionally among the remaining members.

For a bank with the statutory minimum capital of CHF 10 million, the cap
would be CHF 5 million. For larger banks with higher minimum capital
requirements, the cap is correspondingly higher.

8.4 Collateral Requirement (since 1 January 2023)

As of 1 January 2023, member banks must deposit 50% of their individual
payment obligation with a third-party custodian in advance, in the form
of securities or money (Art. 37h para. 3quater BankA). The deadline for
initial collateral deposits was 1 December 2023.

The remaining 50% is subject to the ordinary liquidity requirements
applicable to banks and is called upon only when needed.

8.5 Contribution Periods

The contribution data reported by banks is used for the following
contribution periods:
- Data as of 31.12.2024: contribution period 01.07.2025 - 30.06.2026
- Data as of 31.12.2023: contribution period 01.07.2024 - 30.06.2025
- Data as of 31.12.2022: contribution period 01.07.2023 - 30.06.2024


9. SYSTEM LIMIT
-----------------

The system limit represents the maximum aggregate amount that esisuisse
can call upon from all member banks in any single insolvency event or
series of related events.

Historical development of the system limit:

- Prior to 2008: CHF 4 billion
- 2008 legislative reform: increased to CHF 6 billion
- 1 January 2023 reform: changed from a fixed nominal amount to a
  formula-based approach of 1.6% of all protected deposits, resulting
  in approximately CHF 7.9 billion (previously CHF 6 billion)

The current system limit is approximately CHF 7.96 billion (based on
31.12.2024 data). This amount is recalculated annually based on the
most recent deposit data submitted by member banks.

Important notes on the system limit:
- The 1.6% figure is set by the Federal Council and may be adjusted
- If a bank failure exceeds the system limit, depositors may not receive
  full immediate payout; the remainder would be subject to the ordinary
  bankruptcy proceedings
- The system limit applies to the aggregate of all ongoing insolvency
  events simultaneously requiring esisuisse funding
- In 2009, proposals to increase the limit to CHF 10 billion and to
  introduce ex-ante funding were rejected by the Swiss legislature


10. INDIVIDUAL BANK CONTRIBUTION CAPS
---------------------------------------

Individual bank contributions are subject to a cap to prevent excessive
strain on any single institution (Art. 37h para. 3ter BankA).

The cap is set at 50% of the bank's required minimum capital, calculated
as follows:

(a) The "minimum capital" refers to the regulatory minimum capital
    requirement applicable to the bank under the Capital Adequacy
    Ordinance (CAO; SR 952.03), not the bank's actual capital.

(b) For a standard bank with the statutory minimum of CHF 10 million,
    the cap is CHF 5 million.

(c) For systemically important banks (UBS, PostFinance, Raiffeisen,
    Zürcher Kantonalbank), the minimum capital requirement is
    substantially higher, and so is the contribution cap.

(d) If a bank's proportional share of the system-wide payment obligation
    exceeds its 50% minimum capital cap, the excess amount is
    redistributed among remaining member banks (subject to their own
    caps).

(e) This cap mechanism is designed to ensure that deposit insurance
    contributions do not themselves destabilize the contributing banks.


11. FUNDING MECHANISM (EX-POST CONTRIBUTIONS)
-----------------------------------------------

The Swiss deposit insurance system is fundamentally ex-post in nature,
meaning that member banks contribute funds only after an insolvency event
has occurred, rather than building up a pre-funded reserve.

11.1 How the Ex-Post System Works

(a) An insolvency event is triggered (FINMA opens bankruptcy proceedings).

(b) The bank's own liquid assets are used first to pay out protected
    deposits (Art. 37b BankA).

(c) If the bank's liquidity is insufficient, the liquidator notifies
    esisuisse of the shortfall.

(d) esisuisse issues a call for contributions to all member banks.

(e) Member banks must transfer their share of the required amount to
    esisuisse. Since 1 January 2023, 50% of each bank's obligation is
    already held as collateral with a third-party custodian and can be
    released immediately.

(f) esisuisse transfers the collected funds to the liquidator within
    seven working days.

(g) The liquidator disburses the funds to depositors.

(h) esisuisse subsequently recovers its outlays through the bankruptcy
    dividend as a second-class creditor.

11.2 Advantages of the Ex-Post Model

- No opportunity cost: banks do not lock up capital in a standing fund
- No investment risk on fund assets
- Full system capacity available at all times (subject to member
  solvency)

11.3 Disadvantages and Criticisms

- Pro-cyclical: contributions are called precisely when the banking
  system may be under stress
- Reliance on member solvency: if multiple banks fail simultaneously,
  remaining banks must absorb larger contributions
- No pre-funded buffer for immediate deployment
- Slower than pre-funded systems in theory (though the collateral
  requirement since 2023 partially addresses this)

11.4 Hybrid Element (since 2023)

The 2023 reform introduced a hybrid element: 50% of each bank's payment
obligation must be deposited as collateral (securities or cash) with a
third-party custodian. This pre-positioned collateral can be released
rapidly, effectively creating a partial pre-funding mechanism while
retaining the overall ex-post structure.


12. SELF-REGULATION RECOGNIZED BY FINMA
-----------------------------------------

The Swiss deposit insurance system operates as a self-regulatory scheme
under the umbrella of FINMA recognition, pursuant to Art. 37h BankA.

12.1 Legal Framework

The Banking Act sets the statutory framework (Arts. 37a-37jbis), but
the operational details are governed by esisuisse's self-regulatory
documents:

- Statutes of esisuisse (current version: 23.12.2022)
- Self-Regulation Agreement (current version: 23.12.2022)
- Memorandum of Understanding between esisuisse and FINMA

FINMA recognizes the self-regulation as meeting the statutory
requirements of the Banking Act. This recognition is essential: without
it, the self-regulation would have no binding legal effect on member
institutions.

12.2 FINMA Oversight

Although esisuisse operates the scheme, FINMA maintains supervisory
oversight:
- FINMA monitors whether member banks can comply with contribution
  obligations
- FINMA coordinates with esisuisse in insolvency events
- FINMA may intervene if the self-regulation is inadequate
- The MoU formalizes information exchange between esisuisse and FINMA
- FINMA reviews the adequacy of the scheme periodically

12.3 Self-Regulation Content

The self-regulation documents cover:
- Membership criteria and admission procedures
- Data reporting obligations and formats
- Contribution calculation methodology
- Collateral requirements and custodian arrangements
- Payout procedures and timelines
- Client information requirements (standardized website texts)
- Governance of esisuisse (board composition, annual general meeting)
- Dispute resolution between esisuisse and members


13. COVERAGE EXCLUSIONS — DETAILED ANALYSIS
----------------------------------------------

Understanding what is NOT covered is as important as knowing what is
protected. The following categories are explicitly excluded from Swiss
deposit insurance:

13.1 Amount-Based Exclusions
- Any deposit amount exceeding CHF 100,000 per client per bank
- The excess portion is classified as a third-class bankruptcy claim

13.2 Entity-Based Exclusions (since 1 January 2023)
- Deposits by banks (interbank deposits)
- Deposits by securities firms
- Deposits by insurance companies
- These financial intermediary deposits lost protection in the 2023 reform

13.3 Product-Based Exclusions
- Securities in custody (segregated client assets, not deposits)
- Cryptocurrency units in custody
- Structured products and derivatives
- Insurance wrapper products
- Bonds and debt instruments (except qualifying medium-term notes)
- Safe deposit box contents
- Credit balances not in government-issued currencies

13.4 Institutional Exclusions
- Deposits at fintech license holders (Art. 1b BankA)
- Deposits at sandbox entities (Art. 6 para. 2 BankO)
- Deposits at non-FINMA-authorized institutions
- Deposits at non-account-holding securities firms

13.5 Status-Based Exclusions
- Dormant assets (where the depositor cannot be located and has had no
  contact with the bank)

13.6 Structural Exclusions
- Deposits held through virtual IBANs or correspondent accounts where
  the depositor is not the direct contractual partner of the Swiss bank
- Nominee or omnibus account structures where the beneficial owner is
  not identifiable to the bank


14. PAYOUT PROCESS AND TIMELINES
----------------------------------

14.1 Current Payout Process (as of 1 January 2023)

The payout process involves multiple parties: FINMA (as supervisory
authority), the appointed liquidator, esisuisse, and the depositors.

Timeline overview:

Day 0: FINMA opens bankruptcy proceedings and appoints a liquidator.

Day 0 to Day 5: The liquidator identifies depositors with protected
claims, prepares payout forms, and contacts clients.

Day 5 onwards: Clients receive payout instruction forms and return them
to the liquidator with banking details for the payout.

Parallel track (if bank liquidity is insufficient):
- The liquidator notifies esisuisse of the funding shortfall.
- esisuisse calls on member banks for contributions.
- esisuisse transfers funds to the liquidator within 7 working days
  (Art. 37h para. 3quinquies BankA).

After receiving client instructions: The liquidator disburses funds to
depositors. Current practice: several weeks can be expected, depending
on the complexity of the bank's client structure and client cooperation.

14.2 Target Payout Timeline (effective 1 January 2028)

From 1 January 2028, the target is to complete payout within seven
working days after the liquidator receives the client's payout
instruction (Art. 37b para. 2 BankA as amended). This is a significant
acceleration from current practice.

14.3 Key Payout Rules

(a) Payout is made to the depositor's designated account at another
    bank. Cash payouts are not standard practice.

(b) If the depositor does not respond to the liquidator's request for
    payout instructions, the funds remain with the liquidation estate
    and are subject to the ordinary bankruptcy procedure.

(c) The liquidator must process payouts without offsetting the bank's
    claims against the depositor (no netting of mortgages or loans).

(d) For pension deposits (Pillar 3a, vested benefits), payout is made
    to the relevant pension institution, not directly to the individual.


15. CROSS-BORDER CONSIDERATIONS
----------------------------------

15.1 Foreign Branches of Swiss Banks

Deposits at foreign branches of Swiss banks are treated differently from
deposits at the Swiss head office:

- They are NOT covered by deposit insurance (esisuisse does not pay)
- They DO enjoy preferential bankruptcy status (second creditor class)
  up to CHF 100,000
- They are treated as a separate client relationship from the Swiss
  branch deposits
- The depositor at a foreign branch is a separate "depositor" from the
  same person's relationship at the Swiss head office
- Payout occurs only during the ordinary liquidation process (not via
  the immediate payout mechanism)

15.2 Swiss Branches of Foreign Banks

Foreign banks operating branches in Switzerland with FINMA authorization
are members of esisuisse. Deposits at such branches are covered by Swiss
deposit insurance up to CHF 100,000.

However, if the foreign bank also has home-country deposit insurance, the
Swiss depositor may have a choice or may benefit from dual coverage,
depending on the bilateral arrangements.

15.3 Clients Resident Abroad

Swiss deposit insurance protects all clients regardless of their country
of residence or domicile. The decisive factor is whether the bank is
a FINMA-authorized institution operating in Switzerland, not the
depositor's location.

15.4 Virtual IBANs and Correspondent Banking

Deposits held through virtual Swiss IBANs or correspondent account
structures are NOT protected by Swiss deposit insurance if the depositor
is not the direct contractual partner of the Swiss bank. The decisive
criterion is the direct contractual relationship between the depositor
and the FINMA-authorized institution.


16. JOINT ACCOUNT TREATMENT
------------------------------

The treatment of joint accounts changed significantly with the 2023
reform.

16.1 Rules Effective 1 January 2023

(a) If several persons own an account together (joint account), the
    group of joint account holders is treated as a single, separate
    client (Art. 37a para. 2 BankA).

(b) The joint account receives a single CHF 100,000 protection limit.
    The balance is NOT divided among the individual holders for purposes
    of calculating coverage.

(c) Each joint account holder's separate individual accounts at the same
    bank receive independent CHF 100,000 protection.

(d) Amounts on the joint account exceeding CHF 100,000 fall into the
    third creditor class.

(e) Surplus amounts from a joint account cannot be transferred or
    attributed to one of the individual holders' separate protection
    entitlements.

16.2 Previous Rules (before 1 January 2023)

Under the pre-2023 regime, joint account balances were divided among the
account holders, and each holder's share was then added to their
individual deposits at the same bank, with the aggregate subject to the
CHF 100,000 limit per person. This could result in higher aggregate
protection for married couples or other joint holders.

16.3 Practical Example

Spouses A and B hold:
- Joint account: CHF 150,000
- A's individual account: CHF 80,000
- B's individual account: CHF 60,000

Protection under current rules (since 2023):
- Joint account: CHF 100,000 protected (CHF 50,000 in third class)
- A's individual account: CHF 80,000 protected
- B's individual account: CHF 60,000 protected
- Total protection: CHF 240,000

Under previous rules (before 2023):
- Joint account split: A = CHF 75,000, B = CHF 75,000
- A total: CHF 75,000 + CHF 80,000 = CHF 155,000 => CHF 100,000 protected
- B total: CHF 75,000 + CHF 60,000 = CHF 135,000 => CHF 100,000 protected
- Total protection: CHF 200,000

Thus, the 2023 reform can result in either higher or lower total
protection depending on individual circumstances.


17. PILLAR 2 AND PILLAR 3a PENSION DEPOSIT PROTECTION
--------------------------------------------------------

Pension deposits receive special treatment under Swiss depositor
protection law. It is critical to distinguish between deposit insurance
(esisuisse payout) and bankruptcy privilege (preferential creditor
status).

17.1 Pillar 3a Deposits — Account Solution (Cash)

(a) Pillar 3a cash deposits are NOT covered by deposit insurance.
    esisuisse does NOT pay out Pillar 3a deposits.

(b) They DO enjoy bankruptcy privilege: Pillar 3a deposits are
    classified as second-class creditor claims up to CHF 100,000 per
    client and per foundation (Art. 37a para. 1 BankA).

(c) This is a separate entitlement from regular deposit protection.
    A client with CHF 100,000 in a regular savings account and
    CHF 100,000 in a Pillar 3a account at the same bank has
    CHF 200,000 in total privileged claims.

(d) Payout of Pillar 3a deposits occurs during or after liquidation
    proceedings (not via the immediate payout mechanism). Payment is
    made to the pension foundation, not to the individual.

(e) Proposed legislation: Both chambers of the Swiss parliament have
    supported removing the CHF 100,000 cap on Pillar 3a bankruptcy
    privilege, which would protect the full amount of Pillar 3a cash
    deposits in bankruptcy. This reform is pending as of 2025.

17.2 Pillar 3a Deposits — Securities Solution

Securities held in Pillar 3a custody accounts are not affected by bank
bankruptcy. They are the property of the pension foundation and are
segregated from the bank's assets. They are returned to the foundation
in bankruptcy, not subject to the CHF 100,000 limit.

17.3 Vested Benefits Deposits (Freizügigkeitsguthaben / Pillar 2)

(a) Vested benefits cash deposits follow the same rules as Pillar 3a
    cash deposits: NOT covered by deposit insurance, but enjoy second-
    class bankruptcy privilege up to CHF 100,000 per client and per
    foundation.

(b) Securities in vested benefits custody accounts are foundation
    property and are segregated and returned in bankruptcy.

(c) The CHF 100,000 privilege applies per foundation. If a client has
    vested benefits at two different foundations at the same bank, each
    receives up to CHF 100,000 in preferential treatment.

17.4 Insurance-Based Solutions (Pillar 3a and Vested Benefits)

Pension assets held through insurance policies (insurance-based Pillar
3a or vested benefits) are not covered by deposit insurance. They are
protected under insurance supervision law (VAG; SR 961.01) and the
Swiss Insurance Contract Act (VVG; SR 221.229.1).


18. MEDIUM-TERM BOND TREATMENT
---------------------------------

Medium-term notes (Kassenobligationen / Kassenscheine) receive specific
treatment under Swiss depositor protection:

(a) Medium-term notes ARE protected by deposit insurance, PROVIDED that:
    - They are denominated in a government-issued currency
    - They are deposited in custody with the issuing bank
    - They are in the name of the holder

(b) If the medium-term notes are held at a bank other than the issuer,
    they are treated as securities in custody (segregated assets) and
    are not subject to deposit insurance (but are returned to the
    holder as their property).

(c) The value of medium-term notes held at the issuing bank is
    aggregated with other deposits at that bank toward the CHF 100,000
    limit.

(d) Medium-term notes issued by a bank that has entered bankruptcy lose
    their value as debt instruments of the issuer. The deposit insurance
    covers the custodial claim (up to CHF 100,000) if deposited with the
    issuing bank.


19. COMPARISON WITH EU DEPOSIT GUARANTEE SCHEMES DIRECTIVE (DGSD)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The Swiss depositor protection system differs from the EU framework in
several important respects.

19.1 Coverage Level
- Switzerland: CHF 100,000 (approximately EUR 95,000-105,000 depending
  on exchange rate)
- EU (DGSD): EUR 100,000 per depositor per credit institution
- Both systems provide comparable nominal coverage levels

19.2 Funding Model
- Switzerland: Primarily ex-post, with a hybrid element (50% collateral
  since 2023)
- EU (DGSD): Primarily ex-ante, with Member States required to build
  fund reserves of at least 0.8% of covered deposits by 3 July 2024
  (Art. 10 DGSD)
- The Swiss model is fundamentally different in philosophy

19.3 Target Fund Size
- Switzerland: 1.6% of protected deposits (approx. CHF 7.96 billion)
- EU (DGSD): 0.8% of covered deposits (minimum target level)
- Swiss system has a proportionally larger capacity

19.4 Payout Timeline
- Switzerland: Target of 7 working days (esisuisse transfer) with full
  7-working-day client payout target from 2028
- EU (DGSD): 7 working days for payout to depositors (since 2024,
  reduced from 20 working days)
- Similar target timelines

19.5 Scope of Coverage
- Switzerland: Banks and account-holding securities firms
- EU (DGSD): Credit institutions as defined in CRR
- EU system covers only credit institutions; Swiss system also covers
  certain securities firms

19.6 Joint Accounts
- Switzerland: Treated as a single client with CHF 100,000 limit
  (since 2023)
- EU (DGSD): Each joint account holder generally receives individual
  coverage
- Significant difference: EU system is more favorable for joint holders

19.7 Pension Deposits
- Switzerland: NOT covered by deposit insurance (only bankruptcy
  privilege)
- EU (DGSD): Member States may provide higher coverage for certain
  temporary high balances, including pension benefits
- EU system generally provides stronger protection for pension deposits

19.8 Netting / Set-Off
- Switzerland: No netting of bank claims against protected deposits
- EU (DGSD): Varies by Member State; some allow set-off
- Swiss system is more protective against netting

19.9 Cross-Border
- Switzerland: Foreign branches of Swiss banks — privilege only, no
  deposit insurance. Swiss branches of foreign banks — covered.
- EU (DGSD): Home country DGS principle (branch deposits covered by
  home country scheme, with host country topping up if needed)
- Different approaches to cross-border coverage

19.10 Supervision
- Switzerland: Self-regulation recognized by FINMA
- EU (DGSD): Deposit guarantee schemes supervised by national
  designated authorities
- Swiss model relies more heavily on self-regulation


20. REPORTING OBLIGATIONS
---------------------------

Member banks have extensive reporting obligations to esisuisse, which
form the basis for contribution calculations and systemic monitoring.

20.1 Annual Data Submission

All member institutions must report the following data to esisuisse
annually:

(a) Total protected deposits (deposits covered by deposit insurance up
    to CHF 100,000 per client, aggregated across all clients)

(b) Total preferential deposits (including deposits at foreign branches
    and pension deposits enjoying bankruptcy privilege)

(c) Number of depositors with protected claims

(d) Breakdown of deposits by category (savings, current accounts, time
    deposits, medium-term notes)

(e) Asset coverage data (demonstrating compliance with the 125%
    domestic asset coverage ratio)

The reporting date is 31 December of each year. The reported data is
used for the contribution period commencing the following 1 July.

20.2 Client Information Obligations

Member banks must provide standardized client information about deposit
insurance, as prescribed by esisuisse's self-regulation:

(a) Publication of esisuisse client information on the bank's website

(b) Provision of deposit insurance information to clients upon
    establishing a new banking relationship

(c) Information must be provided in at least the bank's business
    languages

(d) Content and format are prescribed by esisuisse's standardized
    templates (last updated: 26.10.2022)

20.3 Reporting to FINMA

FINMA separately monitors compliance with deposit protection
requirements as part of its ongoing supervision:

(a) Annual regulatory audit covers compliance with Art. 37a BankA
    (125% asset coverage ratio)

(b) FINMA receives information from esisuisse under the MoU regarding
    systemic readiness and individual bank compliance

(c) Banks must report any circumstances that may affect their ability
    to meet contribution obligations


21. ANNUAL DATA SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS — DETAILED
-----------------------------------------------------

21.1 Submission Timeline

- Reporting date: 31 December
- Submission deadline: typically within Q1 of the following year
- Data validation: esisuisse verifies submissions and may request
  corrections or supplementary information
- Publication: esisuisse publishes aggregate statistics (total protected
  deposits, number of members) in its annual report and on its website

21.2 Data Quality Requirements

(a) Data must be based on the bank's internal records and reconciled
    with regulatory reporting data submitted to FINMA and the SNB.

(b) The bank's external auditor reviews the deposit data as part of
    the annual regulatory audit.

(c) Material errors or misstatements in reported data may result in
    sanctions under the self-regulation agreement.

21.3 Contribution Period Alignment

Reported data forms the basis for the following contribution period:
- Data as of 31.12.2024 => period 01.07.2025 - 30.06.2026
- Data as of 31.12.2023 => period 01.07.2024 - 30.06.2025

This six-month offset ensures that esisuisse has time to validate
submissions and calculate individual bank obligations before the new
contribution period begins.

21.4 Consequences of Non-Compliance

Failure to submit data or submission of materially inaccurate data may
result in:
- Formal warnings from esisuisse
- Estimation of the bank's contribution by esisuisse (typically
  conservative, i.e., higher than actual)
- Escalation to FINMA for supervisory action
- In extreme cases, membership sanctions under esisuisse statutes


22. SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT BANKS AND DEPOSIT INSURANCE
---------------------------------------------------------

Systemically important banks (too-big-to-fail, or TBTF) are subject to
special resolution planning requirements but remain covered by deposit
insurance.

Currently designated systemically important banks in Switzerland:
- UBS (globally systemically important)
- PostFinance (domestically systemically important)
- Raiffeisen Group (domestically systemically important)
- Zürcher Kantonalbank (domestically systemically important)

Key considerations:
- Deposits at systemically important banks are still protected by
  deposit insurance up to CHF 100,000
- TBTF banks must maintain emergency plans (recovery and resolution
  plans) that include provisions for continuity of depositor access
- In a TBTF resolution scenario, deposits may be maintained through
  bail-in or bridge bank mechanisms rather than through esisuisse
  payout
- The esisuisse system is designed primarily for smaller and medium-
  sized bank failures; a failure of a systemically important bank
  would likely be handled through the TBTF resolution framework


23. CANTONAL BANK STATE GUARANTEES
-------------------------------------

Many cantonal banks benefit from explicit or implicit state guarantees
from their respective cantons. These guarantees supplement deposit
insurance.

(a) State guarantees cover deposits beyond the CHF 100,000 esisuisse
    limit, providing additional protection to depositors.

(b) Not all cantonal banks have state guarantees. Notably, the cantonal
    banks of Vaud (BCV), Bern (BEKB), and Geneva (BCGE) have converted
    to limited state guarantees or have no full guarantee.

(c) The scope and amount of state guarantees vary by canton and are
    governed by cantonal law.

(d) State guarantees are independent of deposit insurance. A depositor
    at a cantonal bank with a state guarantee benefits from both the
    esisuisse protection (up to CHF 100,000) and the cantonal guarantee
    (for amounts beyond CHF 100,000, subject to cantonal law).
