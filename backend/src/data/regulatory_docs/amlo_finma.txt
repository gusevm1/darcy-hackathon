ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING ORDINANCE FINMA (AMLO-FINMA)
Ordinance of the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority on
Combating Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing in the Financial Sector
(Geldwaeschereiverordnung-FINMA, GwV-FINMA) — SR 955.033.0

Comprehensive overview incorporating amendments through 2025

================================================================================
1. SCOPE AND APPLICABILITY
================================================================================

1.1 Overview

The AMLO-FINMA (Anti-Money Laundering Ordinance of FINMA) implements the due
diligence obligations set out in the Anti-Money Laundering Act (AMLA, SR 955.0)
for financial intermediaries that are directly supervised by FINMA. It applies to:

- Banks and securities firms
- Fund management companies and asset managers of collective investment schemes
- DLT trading facilities
- FinTech license holders under Art. 1b Banking Act
- Financial intermediaries directly supervised by FINMA (DSFI) under Art. 14a AMLA
- Insurance companies in the life insurance sector

AMLO-FINMA does not directly apply to SRO-supervised financial intermediaries,
who are instead governed by their respective SRO regulations. However, SRO
regulations must be consistent with AMLO-FINMA and are subject to FINMA approval.

1.2 Relationship with Other Norms

AMLO-FINMA sits below AMLA in the regulatory hierarchy:
- AMLA (federal statute) sets the general framework
- AMLO (Federal Council ordinance, SR 955.01) provides implementing provisions
- AMLO-FINMA provides detailed requirements for FINMA-supervised entities
- SRO regulations provide equivalent requirements for SRO-supervised entities
- The CDB (Agreement on Due Diligence of Banks) provides additional standards
  for banks

1.3 Crypto-Specific Applicability

AMLO-FINMA applies to all FINMA-supervised entities regardless of the technology
used to provide services. This explicitly includes entities that:
- Exchange virtual assets (crypto-to-fiat, fiat-to-crypto, crypto-to-crypto)
- Provide custody of virtual assets (holding private keys)
- Operate DLT trading facilities
- Issue or distribute tokens that qualify as financial instruments
- Provide transfer services for virtual assets

================================================================================
2. IDENTIFICATION OF THE CONTRACTING PARTY (Articles 3–10)
================================================================================

2.1 General Identification Requirements (Art. 3)

When establishing a business relationship, the financial intermediary must
identify the contracting party by collecting and verifying:

For natural persons:
- Full name (first name and surname)
- Date of birth
- Nationality
- Residential address
- Identification based on a valid official identity document (passport or
  identity card) — a copy must be retained

For legal entities:
- Company name
- Registered office
- Identification based on an extract from the commercial register or equivalent
  document proving the entity's existence
- Identification of authorized signatories

2.2 Methods of Identification

(a) Face-to-face identification (Art. 4): The financial intermediary verifies
the identity document in the physical presence of the contracting party. This
is the standard method.

(b) Identification by correspondence (Art. 5): Where a physical meeting is not
possible, the financial intermediary may identify the contracting party through
certified copies of identity documents. The certification must be by a notary,
an official authority, or a regulated financial intermediary.

(c) Online identification (Art. 6): Financial intermediaries may use video and
online identification procedures that meet the requirements of FINMA Circular
2016/7. This includes:
- Video identification (live video call with trained staff)
- Automated identification using biometric verification
- Electronic identity verification using qualified electronic signatures

For crypto businesses, online identification is the predominant method and must
meet heightened security standards, including liveness detection, document
authenticity verification, and cross-referencing with available databases.

(d) Identification via third parties (Art. 7): The financial intermediary may
delegate identification to another FINMA-supervised financial intermediary or
a regulated foreign financial intermediary, subject to specific conditions
including a written delegation agreement, equivalent standards, and access to
the underlying identification documents.

2.3 Threshold-Based Identification for Virtual Assets

For virtual asset transactions, identification thresholds are:
- CHF 0 (from the first franc) for establishing a business relationship
- CHF 1,000 for occasional virtual asset transfers (travel rule threshold)
- CHF 5,000 for occasional money exchange transactions
- CHF 25,000 for other occasional transactions

These lower thresholds for virtual assets reflect the heightened ML/TF risk
associated with pseudo-anonymous digital assets.

================================================================================
3. CUSTOMER DUE DILIGENCE (CDD) — RISK-BASED APPROACH
================================================================================

3.1 Risk Classification (Art. 12–15)

Financial intermediaries must classify business relationships and transactions
according to their money laundering and terrorist financing risk. The risk
classification drives the intensity of due diligence measures:

(a) Standard risk: Normal due diligence applies (identification, BO verification,
purpose of business relationship, ongoing monitoring).

(b) Increased risk: Enhanced due diligence (EDD) applies. Increased-risk
criteria include:
- Politically exposed persons (PEPs) — domestic or foreign
- Clients domiciled in or connected to high-risk countries
- Complex structures or multi-layered corporate chains
- Unusual transaction patterns
- Cash-intensive businesses
- Activities involving virtual assets (depending on the specific risk assessment)
- Correspondent banking relationships
- Non-face-to-face business relationships (unless robust online identification
  is used)

(c) Reduced risk: Simplified due diligence (SDD) may apply in limited
circumstances (see below).

3.2 Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) Triggers and Measures (Art. 13–15)

When EDD is triggered, the financial intermediary must, in addition to standard
CDD:

- Obtain additional information about the client's background, source of wealth,
  source of funds, and purpose of the transaction or business relationship
- Conduct enhanced ongoing monitoring with more frequent reviews
- Escalate the business relationship to senior management for approval
- Document the EDD measures taken and the rationale for maintaining or
  terminating the relationship

Specific EDD triggers:

(a) PEPs (Art. 13): Persons entrusted with prominent public functions, their
family members, and close associates. EDD includes:
- Determination of whether the person is a PEP (using databases, self-declaration,
  and public sources)
- Identification of the source of wealth and source of funds
- Senior management approval for establishing or continuing the relationship
- Enhanced ongoing monitoring

(b) High-risk countries (Art. 14): Countries identified by FATF as having
strategic AML/CFT deficiencies, or countries that FINMA or the financial
intermediary itself has identified as presenting elevated risk. EDD includes:
- Enhanced scrutiny of the purpose and background of transactions
- Additional documentation requirements
- More frequent monitoring and reviews

(c) Complex structures (Art. 15): Business relationships involving complex
corporate structures, trusts, foundations, or arrangements that lack a clear
economic rationale. EDD includes:
- Identification of all relevant parties in the structure
- Understanding the purpose of the structure
- Verification that the structure is not being used to obscure beneficial
  ownership

3.3 Simplified Due Diligence (SDD) (Art. 11)

SDD may be applied when the ML/TF risk is demonstrably low. Eligible situations
include:
- Contracting parties that are themselves FINMA-supervised financial
  intermediaries
- Publicly listed companies subject to disclosure requirements
- Swiss public-law entities
- Low-value products with limited functionality (e.g., prepaid cards with low
  limits)

Even with SDD, the financial intermediary must still identify the contracting
party and remains obligated to conduct due diligence if suspicion arises.

================================================================================
4. BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP MONITORING (Articles 16–20)
================================================================================

4.1 Ongoing Monitoring (Art. 16)

Financial intermediaries must monitor business relationships on an ongoing basis
to ensure that:
- Transactions are consistent with the known purpose and background of the
  business relationship
- The client's risk profile remains accurate
- Documents, data, and information collected during CDD are kept up to date

The intensity and frequency of monitoring must be commensurate with the risk
classification. High-risk relationships require more frequent and detailed reviews.

4.2 Transaction Monitoring (Art. 17)

Financial intermediaries must implement systems and procedures to detect unusual
or suspicious transactions, including:

- Transactions inconsistent with the client's known profile or the purpose of
  the business relationship
- Transactions without apparent economic or lawful purpose
- Transactions involving high-risk jurisdictions
- Unusually large or complex transactions
- Patterns suggesting structuring (splitting transactions to avoid thresholds)

For virtual asset businesses, transaction monitoring must include:
- Blockchain analytics tools to trace transaction origins and destinations
- Detection of transactions involving sanctioned or flagged wallet addresses
- Identification of mixing, tumbling, or obfuscation techniques
- Monitoring of transaction patterns indicative of illicit activity

4.3 Periodic Reviews (Art. 18)

Standard-risk relationships: Review at least annually or when triggered by events.
Increased-risk relationships: Review at least semi-annually.
PEP relationships: Review at least annually with senior management sign-off.

Reviews must include an update of the client risk assessment, verification that
CDD information remains current, and assessment of transaction patterns.

================================================================================
5. SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY REPORTING TO MROS (Articles 21–23)
================================================================================

5.1 Duty to Report (Art. 21)

Reflecting Art. 9 AMLA, the financial intermediary must file a Suspicious Activity
Report (SAR) with MROS when it knows or has reasonable grounds to suspect that:
- Assets involved in the business relationship are connected to money laundering,
  a predicate offence, terrorist financing, or a criminal organization
- Assets are subject to the power of disposal of a criminal organization
- Negotiations for a business relationship have been broken off because the
  client refused to provide required identification or BO information

5.2 SAR Content and Format (Art. 22)

SARs must be filed electronically through the goAML platform and must include:
- Identification of the reporting financial intermediary
- Identification of the client and relevant parties
- Description of the business relationship and relevant transactions
- Nature and basis of the suspicion
- Actions taken by the financial intermediary (e.g., asset freeze)
- All supporting documentation

5.3 Post-Reporting Obligations (Art. 23)

After filing a SAR:
- The financial intermediary must freeze the relevant assets immediately
- The financial intermediary must not tip off the client or third parties
- The financial intermediary must comply with all MROS instructions
- The freeze lasts 5 business days unless MROS extends it through prosecution
  referral
- The financial intermediary must cooperate fully with MROS and any subsequent
  criminal investigation

================================================================================
6. RECORD-KEEPING REQUIREMENTS (Articles 24–26)
================================================================================

6.1 Scope of Records (Art. 24)

Financial intermediaries must maintain complete records of:
- All CDD documents (identification documents, BO declarations, risk
  classifications, EDD records)
- Transaction records sufficient to reconstruct all transactions
- Correspondence with clients relevant to AML compliance
- Internal reports, escalation records, and decision memos
- Training records
- SAR filings and related documentation

6.2 Retention Period (Art. 25)

All records must be retained for a minimum of 10 years from:
- The end of the business relationship, or
- The completion of the transaction (for occasional transactions)

6.3 Format and Accessibility (Art. 26)

Records may be maintained in physical or electronic form. They must be:
- Stored in Switzerland or in a location accessible to Swiss authorities
- Organized in a manner that allows prompt retrieval
- Protected against unauthorized access, loss, or destruction
- Available for inspection by FINMA, auditors, and law enforcement upon request

================================================================================
7. TRAVEL RULE OBLIGATIONS (Article 10 AMLO-FINMA)
================================================================================

7.1 Overview

Article 10 AMLO-FINMA implements the FATF Recommendation 16 (travel rule) for
electronic transfers, including virtual asset transfers. It requires that
originator and beneficiary information accompany all qualifying transfers.

7.2 Requirements for Virtual Asset Transfers

For all virtual asset transfers of CHF 1,000 or more, the ordering financial
intermediary must transmit:
- Full name of the originator
- Account number or wallet address of the originator
- Address, date of birth, or identification number of the originator
- Full name of the beneficiary
- Account number or wallet address of the beneficiary

The beneficiary's financial intermediary must:
- Verify that originator information is complete
- Request missing information if incomplete
- Reject or return the transfer if information cannot be obtained

7.3 Transfers Below CHF 1,000

For virtual asset transfers below CHF 1,000, the ordering financial intermediary
must still record originator and beneficiary information internally but is not
required to transmit it with the transfer unless there is suspicion of ML/TF.

7.4 Unhosted Wallet Transfers

Transfers to or from unhosted (non-custodial) wallets present particular
challenges because there is no counterparty financial intermediary. In such cases:
- The financial intermediary must collect the identity of the wallet holder
- The financial intermediary must verify ownership of the unhosted wallet
  (e.g., through a signed message or micro-transfer)
- Enhanced due diligence applies for significant or repeated transfers to
  unhosted wallets
- The financial intermediary must document its risk assessment

7.5 Technical Implementation

Financial intermediaries may use recognized travel rule protocols such as:
- TRISA (Travel Rule Information Sharing Architecture)
- OpenVASP
- Sygna Bridge
- Other interoperable solutions

The choice of protocol is left to the financial intermediary, but it must
ensure that the solution reliably transmits required information and that
counterparty VASPs are appropriately verified.

================================================================================
8. CRYPTO-SPECIFIC PROVISIONS
================================================================================

8.1 Classification of Tokens

AMLO-FINMA applies differently depending on the FINMA token classification:

(a) Payment tokens (e.g., Bitcoin, Ether): Full AMLA due diligence applies to
all services involving payment tokens, including exchange, custody, and transfer.

(b) Utility tokens: Generally not subject to AMLA unless they also function as
payment tokens or are traded on secondary markets in a way that constitutes
financial intermediation.

(c) Asset tokens (security tokens): Subject to AMLA when services constitute
securities dealing or custody. Additionally subject to securities regulation.

(d) Stablecoins: Treated as payment tokens with additional scrutiny due to
their potential for large-scale payment use and associated ML/TF risks.

8.2 ICO/ITO/STO Due Diligence

Token issuers that qualify as financial intermediaries must apply AMLA due
diligence to all token purchasers. This includes:
- Identification of all investors before tokens are distributed
- Beneficial ownership verification
- Source of funds verification for significant investments
- Sanctions screening of all investors

8.3 DeFi Considerations

For entities operating DeFi protocols that fall within AMLA scope:
- The operator must implement CDD to the extent technically feasible
- Risk-based measures must be proportionate to the level of control
- FINMA expects ongoing development of compliance solutions for DeFi

8.4 Staking and Lending

Crypto staking and lending platforms that accept client assets are generally
considered financial intermediaries and must:
- Apply full AMLA due diligence
- Implement transaction monitoring
- Comply with travel rule requirements for asset transfers
- Maintain segregated client asset records

================================================================================
9. ORGANIZATIONAL REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================

9.1 AML Compliance Function (Art. 27)

officer (or function) responsible for:
- Overseeing the implementation of AML policies and procedures
- Advising business units on AML matters
- Reviewing and approving high-risk business relationships
- Filing SARs with MROS
- Coordinating with FINMA and auditors
- Conducting or overseeing AML training

The compliance officer must have appropriate qualifications, experience, and
authority, and must report directly to senior management or the board.

9.2 Training (Art. 28)

Financial intermediaries must provide regular AML training to all relevant staff:
- Initial training for new employees
- Refresher training at least annually
- Specialized training for staff in high-risk areas

- An independent internal audit function (or outsourced equivalent) that
  regularly reviews AML compliance
- An external audit by a FINMA-recognized audit firm

================================================================================
10. SANCTIONS SCREENING
================================================================================

10.1 Swiss Sanctions Framework

Financial intermediaries must comply with Swiss sanctions, which implement:
- UN Security Council sanctions

- All counterparties in transactions
- All beneficiaries

For crypto businesses, screening must include:
- Wallet address screening against known sanctioned addresses
- Blockchain analytics to detect indirect sanctions exposure
- Screening of counterparty VASPs

================================================================================
11. ENFORCEMENT AND PENALTIES
================================================================================

FINMA has broad enforcement powers for AMLO-FINMA violations:
- Orders to remedy deficiencies with deadlines
- Appointment of investigating agents or supervisory agents
- License revocation
- Publication of enforcement decisions
- Industry bans for responsible individuals
- Criminal referrals to prosecution authorities

FINMA has been active in enforcing AML requirements against crypto businesses
and has issued several enforcement actions in this area since 2018.
