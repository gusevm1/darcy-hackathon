FINMA FINTECH LICENSE
Authorization under Art. 1b of the Swiss Banking Act
Comprehensive Guide to the FinTech License for Innovative Financial Services

================================================================================
1. OVERVIEW AND LEGAL BASIS
================================================================================

1.1 Introduction

The FINMA FinTech license (also referred to as the "banking license light" or
"innovation license") was introduced on January 1, 2019, through the addition
of Art. 1b to the Swiss Banking Act (BA, SR 952.0). It creates a new
authorization category specifically designed for innovative financial service
providers that accept public deposits but do not engage in the traditional
banking business of lending and maturity transformation.

The FinTech license bridges the gap between SRO membership (no deposit-taking
permitted) and a full banking license (extensive requirements). It allows
qualifying businesses to accept public deposits of up to CHF 100 million
without the full regulatory burden of a banking license.

1.2 Legal Basis

- Banking Act (BA), Art. 1b: Core provision establishing the FinTech license
- Banking Ordinance (BO), Art. 13a–13h: Implementing provisions
- FINMA Circular 2008/3 "Public Deposits with Non-Banks": Clarification of
  deposit-taking thresholds
- AMLA and AMLO-FINMA: AML obligations for FinTech license holders
- FINMA Guidance: Various guidance documents on application procedures and
  expectations

1.3 Policy Rationale

The Swiss Federal Council introduced the FinTech license to:
- Lower barriers to entry for innovative financial services
- Maintain Switzerland's competitiveness as a fintech hub
- Provide a proportionate regulatory framework for businesses that accept
  deposits but do not engage in credit intermediation
- Enable crypto and blockchain businesses to operate within a clear legal
  framework

================================================================================
2. SCOPE — WHAT THE LICENSE ALLOWS
================================================================================

2.1 Core Permission: Accept Public Deposits up to CHF 100 Million

The FinTech license authorizes the holder to accept deposits from the public up
to a total of CHF 100 million. "Public deposits" means funds received from more
than 20 depositors or funds received through public solicitation, which would
otherwise require a full banking license under Art. 1 para. 2 BA.

2.2 Key Restriction: No Investment or Interest

The fundamental limitation of the FinTech license is that deposits received:
- May NOT be invested in any manner
- May NOT bear interest
- Must be held in readily available form (e.g., in bank accounts or, for
  crypto businesses, in secure wallets)

This restriction ensures that FinTech license holders do not engage in maturity
transformation or credit intermediation — the core activities that give rise to
banking-specific risks and require a full banking license.

2.3 Suitable Business Models

The FinTech license is designed for and commonly used by:

(a) Payment service providers:
    - Companies that hold client funds for payment processing
    - E-money issuers (within Swiss regulatory classification)
    - Remittance services holding settlement funds

(b) Crypto custody platforms:
    - Companies that hold fiat currency or stablecoins on behalf of clients
    - Crypto exchanges that hold client fiat balances
    - Important: Holding pure crypto assets (e.g., BTC, ETH) may not constitute
      "deposit-taking" under the Banking Act, but holding fiat or fiat-
      equivalent funds on behalf of clients does

(c) Crowdfunding and crowdlending platforms:
    - Platforms that temporarily hold investor funds before deployment
    - Settlement accounts for peer-to-peer transactions

(d) Trading platforms (without order books):
    - Crypto exchanges that match buyers and sellers without a central order
      book (acting as principal or broker)
    - Platforms that hold client funds during the trading process

(e) Stablecoin issuers:
    - Depending on the stablecoin structure, issuers may need a FinTech license
      or full banking license

2.4 Activities NOT Covered

The FinTech license does NOT authorize:
- Lending or credit business
- Investment of client deposits
- Operating an exchange with a central order book (requires DLT trading facility
  license or banking license)
- Asset management (requires FinIA license)
- Securities dealing (requires securities firm license)

================================================================================
3. KEY REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================

3.1 Capital Requirements

(a) Minimum capital: CHF 300,000

(b) OR 5% of accepted public deposits — whichever is higher

(c) The capital must be:
    - Fully paid up
    - Maintained at all times
    - Composed of qualifying capital (equity, retained earnings)
    - Not encumbered or pledged

(d) Example:
    - At CHF 6 million in deposits: 5% = CHF 300,000 (minimum applies)
    - At CHF 10 million in deposits: 5% = CHF 500,000
    - At CHF 50 million in deposits: 5% = CHF 2,500,000
    - At CHF 100 million in deposits: 5% = CHF 5,000,000

3.2 Organizational Requirements

(a) Legal form: Swiss legal entity (AG, GmbH, or cooperative)

(b) Registered office and place of management in Switzerland

(c) Board of Directors:
    - Minimum 3 members for an AG
    - At least one member must be Swiss-resident
    - Members must be fit and proper (no criminal convictions for financial
      crimes, no regulatory bans, adequate professional qualifications)
    - Independent risk oversight function

(d) Executive Management:
    - Must be conducted from Switzerland
    - At least two members of the executive management (dual control principle)
    - Must be fit and proper
    - Must possess adequate professional experience and qualifications

(e) AML Compliance Officer:
    - Dedicated qualified compliance officer
    - Must have appropriate authority, reporting line to the board
    - Relevant experience in AML compliance (minimum 2–3 years)

(f) Internal controls:
    - Internal control system (ICS) proportionate to the size and complexity
      of the business
    - Risk management framework
    - Compliance function
    - Internal audit (may be outsourced for smaller entities)

3.3 Client Information Duty

FinTech license holders must inform clients before establishing a business
relationship that:
- The company is not a bank
- Deposits are not covered by the Swiss deposit insurance scheme (esisuisse)

This disclosure must be made clearly and prominently.

3.4 Deposit Insurance Exclusion

Unlike banks, FinTech license holders are NOT members of esisuisse (Swiss
deposit insurance scheme). Client deposits are therefore not insured up to
CHF 100,000 per depositor, as they would be with a bank. This must be clearly
disclosed to clients.

3.5 No Depositor Preference

In the event of insolvency, depositors of a FinTech license holder do not
benefit from the depositor preference that applies to banks under the Banking
Act. However, if deposits are segregated, clients may be able to claim them
outside the bankruptcy estate.

================================================================================
5. ONGOING SUPERVISION AND REPORTING
================================================================================

5.1 FINMA Supervision

FinTech license holders are directly supervised by FINMA:
- FINMA is the primary supervisory authority
- AML compliance is supervised under AMLO-FINMA (not through an SRO)
- FINMA may conduct inspections, request information, and issue orders

5.2 External Audit

- Annual audit by a FINMA-recognized audit firm
- Scope: financial audit and regulatory audit (including AML compliance)
- Audit report submitted to FINMA
- Remediation of audit findings within FINMA-set deadlines

5.3 Reporting Obligations

FinTech license holders must report to FINMA:
- Annual financial statements (audited)
- Annual regulatory report
- Deposit volume reports (monthly or quarterly)
- Material change notifications (changes to board, management, beneficial
  owners, business model, etc.)
- Significant operational incidents (cybersecurity breaches, system failures,
  fraud, etc.)
- SAR filings (notification to FINMA alongside MROS filing)

5.4 Capital Monitoring

- The licensee must monitor its capital ratio continuously
- If deposits approach the CHF 100 million limit or the capital ratio drops
  below 5%, the licensee must take action
- FINMA must be notified immediately if the licensee breaches capital
  requirements

7. TRANSITION SCENARIOS
================================================================================

7.1 From FINMA Sandbox to FinTech License

The FINMA sandbox (Art. 6 para. 2–4 BO) allows businesses to accept deposits
from up to 20 persons, not exceeding CHF 1 million total, without any license.
When the business grows beyond these thresholds, it must obtain a FinTech
license or banking license.

7.2 From FinTech License to Banking License

If the business exceeds the CHF 100 million deposit limit, or if the business
model evolves to include lending or deposit investment, the entity must upgrade
to a full banking license. FINMA provides a transition pathway.

7.3 From SRO Membership to FinTech License

Businesses initially operating with SRO membership (e.g., crypto exchanges
within sandbox thresholds) may need to obtain a FinTech license as they grow.
The SRO membership terminates upon obtaining the FinTech license, as the entity
is then directly supervised by FINMA.

================================================================================
8. PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR CRYPTO BUSINESSES
================================================================================

8.1 When a Crypto Business Needs a FinTech License

A crypto business needs a FinTech license when:
- It holds fiat currency deposits from more than 20 clients
- Total fiat deposits exceed CHF 1 million
- It does not invest or pay interest on the deposits
- It does not operate an exchange with a central order book

8.2 Custody of Crypto Assets vs. Fiat Deposits

Important distinction:
- Holding pure crypto assets (BTC, ETH, etc.) for clients may not constitute
  "deposit-taking" under the Banking Act (this is a debated point)
- Holding fiat currency or fiat-pegged stablecoins for clients DOES constitute
  deposit-taking
- Mixed custody (fiat + crypto) triggers the deposit-taking analysis for the
  fiat component

8.3 Stablecoin Considerations

- Fiat-backed stablecoins: issuance likely requires at least a FinTech license
  (depending on structure, may require a full banking license)
- Algorithmic stablecoins: case-by-case analysis
- Using stablecoins: merely using stablecoins does not necessarily require a
  FinTech license, but holding client stablecoins in custody may trigger
  deposit-taking analysis

8.4 Practical Tips

1. Engage FINMA early through the pre-notification process
2. Invest in a robust IT security concept — this is heavily scrutinized
3. Ensure the AML framework is specifically tailored to the crypto business
4. Plan for ongoing compliance costs (audit, supervision, compliance staff)
5. Build the organizational structure before applying (board, management,
   compliance officer must be in place)
6. Consider whether the FINMA sandbox can bridge the gap while the application
   is being processed
