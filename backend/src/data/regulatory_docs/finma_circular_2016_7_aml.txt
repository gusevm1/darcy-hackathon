FINMA CIRCULAR 2016/7: VIDEO AND ONLINE IDENTIFICATION
Due Diligence Obligations under the Swiss AML Framework
Including AMLA, AMLO, AMLO-FINMA, and CDB 20

Last revised: Comprehensive overview incorporating amendments through 2025

================================================================================
1. OVERVIEW OF THE SWISS AML FRAMEWORK
================================================================================

1.1 Regulatory Architecture

Switzerland's anti-money laundering (AML) regime is built on a layered regulatory
architecture comprising federal legislation, executive ordinances, supervisory
ordinances, and self-regulatory standards. The principal instruments are:

(a) Federal Act on Combating Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (AMLA)
    - Formal citation: Geldwaeschereigesetz (GwG), SR 955.0
    - Primary federal statute establishing due diligence obligations for all
      financial intermediaries and the supervisory framework for enforcement.
    - Key articles: Art. 2 (scope), Art. 3 (customer identification), Art. 4
      (beneficial ownership), Art. 5 (renewal of identification), Art. 6
      (nature and purpose of business relationship), Art. 7 (record keeping),
      Art. 9 (reporting to MROS), Art. 10 (asset freezing).

(b) Anti-Money Laundering Ordinance (AMLO)
    - Formal citation: Geldwaeschereiverordnung (GwV), SR 955.01
    - Federal Council ordinance implementing AMLA at the operational level.
    - Specifies identification thresholds, documentation standards, and
      procedural details for due diligence obligations.

(c) FINMA Anti-Money Laundering Ordinance (AMLO-FINMA)
    - Formal citation: Geldwaeschereiverordnung-FINMA (GwV-FINMA), SR 955.033.0
    - FINMA supervisory ordinance applicable to all FINMA-supervised financial
      intermediaries (banks, securities firms, fund management companies,
      insurance companies in life insurance, FinTech license holders, DLT
      trading facilities, and directly supervised financial intermediaries).
    - Key articles: Art. 3-12 (identification and verification), Art. 13-15
      (risk categorization and enhanced due diligence), Art. 16-19 (PEP and
      correspondent banking), Art. 20-21 (transaction monitoring and reporting),
      Art. 22-27 (internal organization, training, and documentation).

(d) Agreement on the Swiss Banks' Code of Conduct with Regard to the Exercise
    of Due Diligence (CDB 20)
    - Adopted by the Swiss Bankers Association (SBA), effective January 1, 2020.
    - Material provisions (Art. 1-57) have ordinance status pursuant to Art. 35
      AMLO-FINMA and apply to all FINMA-supervised financial intermediaries.
    - Prescribes standardized identification and beneficial ownership procedures,
      including the use of Forms A (beneficial owner declaration for natural
      persons), K (controlling person declaration for legal entities), R
      (declaration for trusts), S (declaration for foundations), and T
      (declaration for life insurance).
    - Maximum penalty for violations: CHF 10 million, enforced by the CDB
      Supervisory Board with oversight by statutory auditors.

(e) Swiss Criminal Code (SCC)
    - Art. 305bis SCC: Criminalizes money laundering, defined as any act suited
      to frustrate the identification of the origin, the tracing, or the
      forfeiture of assets which the perpetrator knows or must assume originate
      from a felony or a qualified tax offence (exceeding CHF 300,000 per
      tax period).
    - Art. 305ter SCC: Criminalizes insufficient diligence in financial
      transactions (the "lack of due diligence" offence).

1.2 Scope of Application

AMLA applies to "financial intermediaries" as defined in Art. 2 AMLA:

- Prudentially supervised entities (Art. 2 para. 2): Banks, securities firms,
  fund management companies, asset managers of collective investment schemes,
  custodian banks, DLT trading facilities, insurance institutions in life
  insurance, and FinTech license holders under Art. 1b Banking Act.

- Non-prudentially supervised entities (Art. 2 para. 3): Persons who on a
  professional basis accept, hold on deposit, or help to invest or transfer
  third-party assets, including money changers, payment service providers,
  precious metal dealers (for cash transactions exceeding CHF 15,000), and
  virtual asset service providers.

Since August 1, 2021, service providers enabling the transfer of virtual
currencies to third parties are subject to AMLA if they maintain permanent
business relationships (FINMA distinguishes payment tokens, utility tokens,
and asset tokens accordingly).

1.3 International Standards Alignment

Switzerland implements the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) 40 Recommendations.
The most recent FATF mutual evaluation (2016) rated Switzerland "compliant" or
"largely compliant" on 31 of 40 recommendations. The next comprehensive FATF
evaluation is scheduled for 2027/2028.

================================================================================
2. CUSTOMER DUE DILIGENCE OBLIGATIONS
================================================================================

2.1 General Duty (Art. 3 AMLA / Art. 3-12 AMLO-FINMA)

Financial intermediaries must exercise due diligence in all dealings with
customers. The core CDD obligations are:

(a) Identify the contracting party (Art. 3 AMLA).
(b) Identify the beneficial owner of assets (Art. 4 AMLA).
(c) Ascertain the nature and purpose of the business relationship (Art. 6 AMLA).
(d) Conduct ongoing monitoring of the business relationship.
(e) Maintain adequate records (Art. 7 AMLA).

These obligations must be fulfilled at the establishment of a business
relationship and renewed whenever doubts arise during the relationship
(Art. 5 AMLA).

2.2 Timing of Due Diligence

CDD must be performed:
- Before or at the time of establishing a business relationship.
- Before executing cash transactions exceeding CHF 15,000 (or CHF 25,000 for
  money exchange transactions at bank counters under CDB 20).
- When there is suspicion of money laundering or terrorist financing.
- When doubts arise about the identity of the contracting party or beneficial
  owner.

2.3 Risk-Based Approach

The Swiss AML framework adopts a risk-based approach as recommended by the FATF.
The scope and depth of CDD measures depend on the money laundering risk
represented by the contracting partner (Art. 6 AMLA). Lower-risk relationships
may be subject to simplified due diligence, while higher-risk relationships
require enhanced due diligence (see Section 8 below).

================================================================================
3. CUSTOMER IDENTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================

3.1 Identification of Natural Persons (Art. 3 AMLA / Art. 44 AMLO-FINMA)

When the contracting party is a natural person, the financial intermediary must
collect and verify the following data:

- Surname and first name(s)
- Date of birth
- Nationality
- Domicile address (residential address)
- Type, number, and issuing country of the identification document

Verification is performed on the basis of a document of evidentiary value,
typically a valid passport or identity card issued by a government authority.

3.2 Identification of Legal Entities (Art. 3 AMLA / Art. 45-46 AMLO-FINMA)

For legal entities, the financial intermediary must collect:
- Name or company name
- Registered office address
- Legal form
- Names of the authorized signatories and the power of representation

Verification is based on an extract from the commercial register or equivalent
documents of evidentiary value. The financial intermediary must also verify
the authority of the person acting on behalf of the legal entity by means
of a power of attorney or equivalent documentation.

3.3 Identification of Controlling Persons (CDB 20, Art. 20)

Under CDB 20, banks must identify any natural person holding 25 percent or more
of a legal entity or partnership. If no such individual holds 25 percent or more,
the most senior managing director (e.g., CEO or chairman of the board) must be
identified as the controlling person. The contracting party must confirm the
name, first names, and actual domicile address of the controlling person in
writing or by using Form K.

3.4 Identification Thresholds

- Business relationships (account openings, fiduciary mandates, etc.):
  Identification required regardless of amount.
- Cash transactions without a business relationship: Identification required
  for transactions at or above CHF 15,000 (Art. 3 para. 2 AMLA).
- Currency exchange at bank counters: Identification required for amounts
  at or above CHF 25,000 (CDB 20, Art. 51).

================================================================================
4. VERIFICATION OF IDENTITY
================================================================================

4.1 Face-to-Face Verification (Art. 44 AMLO-FINMA)

The standard method of identity verification requires the physical presence of
the contracting party. The financial intermediary must:

(a) Inspect the original identification document (passport or identity card).
(b) Verify the document's authenticity by examining security features.
(c) Compare the photograph on the document with the person present.
(d) Record the relevant data from the identification document.
(e) Take a copy of the identification document.

The financial intermediary may delegate the identification to a third party
(e.g., a correspondent bank or a regulated financial intermediary) under
Art. 39-43 AMLO-FINMA, provided that the delegating intermediary retains
responsibility for the correct performance of CDD.

4.2 Identification by Correspondence (Art. 48-49 AMLO-FINMA)

Where a business relationship is established by correspondence (i.e., without
face-to-face contact and without the use of video or online identification),
the financial intermediary must obtain a certified copy of the identification
document. The certification must be performed by a notary, a supervised
financial intermediary, or another person authorized under applicable law.
Additional corroborating measures include:
- A first payment from an account in the customer's name at a bank subject
  to equivalent AML regulation.
- Verification of the customer's residential address.

================================================================================
5. VIDEO AND ONLINE IDENTIFICATION (FINMA CIRCULAR 2016/7)
================================================================================

5.1 Purpose and Scope of Circular 2016/7

FINMA Circular 2016/7, first issued in March 2016 and titled "Video and Online
Identification," defines the conditions under which financial intermediaries may
establish business relationships with natural persons remotely, without requiring
physical presence, while maintaining compliance with the AMLA and AMLO-FINMA.

The Circular applies to all FINMA-supervised financial intermediaries, including
banks, securities firms, insurance companies, fund management companies, and
asset managers of collective investment schemes.

The Circular provides two distinct digital onboarding channels:
(a) Video identification (Section A, margin nos. 11-22)
(b) Online identification (Section B, margin nos. 23-34)

Both channels are placed on equal regulatory footing with traditional face-to-face
identification, provided the specified requirements are met.

5.2 Video Identification Procedure (Margin Nos. 11-22)

Video identification involves a live audio-visual meeting between the contracting
party and the financial intermediary (or its authorized representative).

Pre-Meeting Requirements:
- The financial intermediary must collect the data required by Art. 44 and
  Art. 60 AMLO-FINMA prior to the video identification meeting.
- The data collected must be reviewed during the video meeting using appropriate
  technical tools or specific questions.
- The financial intermediary must verify the data against the identification
  documents presented during the meeting.

Consent and Recording:
- Prior to the video meeting, the financial intermediary must obtain the
  contracting party's explicit agreement (consent) to perform a video
  identification.
- The contracting party must consent to an audio recording of the meeting.
- FINMA requires a simple audio recording; a full video recording is not
  mandatory.

Technical and Quality Requirements:
- The picture and audio quality must be adequate to enable unambiguous
  identification of the contracting party.
- The financial intermediary shall use adequate technical tools that allow
  the transmission as well as the reading and decryption of data in the
  machine-readable zone (MRZ) of the identification document.
- The financial intermediary can use technical aids to compensate for poor
  lighting, especially when taking photographs required for identification.

Document Verification:
- The identification document must be inspected during the video meeting.
- The financial intermediary must note any prominent signs indicating a
  forged or altered document.
- The data provided during onboarding must be compared with the data
  appearing in the identification documents.

Documentation and Archiving:
- Each video identification process must be fully documented.
- Photographs of the identification document and the contracting party must
  be filed and archived.
- The audio recording must be retained alongside the documentation.
- All records must be retained for at least 10 years (Art. 7 para. 3 AMLA).

5.3 Online Identification Procedure (Margin Nos. 23-34)

Online identification is a fully automated process that does not require a live
video meeting. It was introduced in the original Circular and significantly
expanded in the 2021 revision.

Original Framework:
- Initially, online identification required a money transfer from an account at
  a Swiss bank or, following the first revision, from a bank in Liechtenstein or
  an FATF member state with equivalent AML standards.

Biometric Passport Data (2021 Revision):
- The revised Circular (effective May 2021) permits fully automated online
  identification using biometric passports.
- The contracting party scans the passport chip data via a smartphone
  application, transmitting personal details and the biometric photograph to
  the financial intermediary.
- Both authenticity and integrity of the chip data must be verified.
- Certificate sources: Swiss Federal Office of Information Technology, Systems
  and Telecommunication (FOITT) provides certificates for Swiss passports;
  the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) master lists apply
  to international biometric passports.

Additional Requirements for Online Identification:
- In addition to MRZ decryption and at least two security feature checks, the
  Circular requires:
  (a) ID certification by a supervised financial intermediary, notary, or Swiss-
      qualified lawyer; OR
  (b) Use of biometric passport chip scanning (post-2021 revision).
- Residential address verification through at least one of the following methods:
  (a) Postal delivery to the declared address.
  (b) Tax or utility bill.
  (c) Public register verification.
  (d) Trusted database consultation.
  (e) Geolocation verification.

Beneficial Ownership Declarations:
- For online onboarding, the beneficial ownership declaration (Form A or
  equivalent) may be completed electronically using a qualified electronic
  signature from a Swiss certification service provider, or alternatively
  through other electronic procedures meeting regulatory standards.

5.4 Use of Third-Party Service Providers

The 2021 revision clarifies the rules on delegation:
- When financial intermediaries engage other financial intermediaries for
  identification duties, those intermediaries may subsequently engage
  specialized third-party service providers for technical aspects of the
  identification process.
- This chaining of delegation was previously prohibited under the original
  Circular.
- The delegating financial intermediary retains full regulatory responsibility
  for the correctness of the identification, regardless of delegation.

5.5 Security Safeguards

FINMA maintains that additional safeguards beyond biometric data are necessary
to prevent abuse, citing:
- Uncertainties in automatic facial recognition technology.
- Suspicious activity reports involving forged identification documents used
  in digital onboarding contexts.
- The need for human oversight in the video identification channel.

5.6 Proposed 2026 Revision

In December 2025, FINMA launched a consultation on a proposed partial revision
of Circular 2016/7, with the consultation period running until February 27, 2026.
The proposed revisions aim to update the Circular in light of technological
developments and practical experience gained since the 2021 revision.

================================================================================
6. BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP DETERMINATION
================================================================================

6.1 Duty to Identify the Beneficial Owner (Art. 4 AMLA)

The financial intermediary must identify the beneficial owner with the due
diligence required in the circumstances and verify its identity in order to
ensure that it knows who the beneficial owner is (Art. 4 para. 1 AMLA).

The beneficial owner is the natural person who ultimately controls the assets
or on whose behalf a transaction is being conducted. The concept differs from
the "contracting party" (the person entering into the business relationship).

6.2 Verification of Beneficial Ownership (2023 AMLA Revision)

As of January 1, 2023, the AMLA revision shifted the obligation from merely
"ascertaining" the beneficial owner to explicitly "verifying" the beneficial
owner's identity. Key requirements:

(a) A risk-based approach prevails for the verification of the beneficial
    owner's identity.
(b) The financial intermediary cannot solely rely on a written and signed
    declaration by the contracting party regarding the beneficial owner
    (e.g., Form A). It must critically examine the plausibility of such
    declaration.
(c) Multiple sources should be consulted: client profiles, public records,
    commercial registers, and external databases.
(d) For natural persons in standard-risk categories, the intermediary should
    confirm consistency between the contracting party's statements and
    available information.
(e) For legal entities, verification should include internal company documents
    such as share registers, beneficial owner notifications, and corporate
    governance documentation.

6.3 CDB 20 Beneficial Ownership Procedures

Under CDB 20, banks must collect a written declaration of beneficial ownership
for all new business relationships involving account openings or securities
transactions, using the following standardized forms:

- Form A: Declaration of beneficial ownership by natural persons.
- Form K: Declaration of controlling person for operating legal entities.
- Form R: Declaration for trusts (identifying the settlor, trustee, protector,
  and beneficiaries).
- Form S: Declaration for foundations.
- Form T: Declaration for life insurance policies (identifying the policyholder
  and beneficiaries).

6.4 Ongoing Monitoring of Beneficial Ownership

The financial intermediary must update beneficial ownership information
whenever:
- Doubts arise about the accuracy of the existing declaration.
- There are indications of a change in beneficial ownership.
- As part of the periodic review of the business relationship (see Section 17).

================================================================================
7. POLITICALLY EXPOSED PERSONS (PEP) HANDLING
================================================================================

7.1 Definition of PEP

Under Art. 2a AMLA, politically exposed persons include:

(a) Foreign PEPs: Persons entrusted with prominent public functions abroad
    (heads of state, senior politicians, senior government officials, military
    leaders, heads of state-owned enterprises, senior judicial officials).
(b) Domestic PEPs: Persons entrusted with prominent public functions in
    Switzerland at the federal level.
(c) PEPs in international organizations: Persons entrusted with prominent
    functions in intergovernmental organizations.
(d) Close associates and family members of the above.

7.2 Identification of PEP Status

Financial intermediaries must determine whether the contracting party, the
beneficial owner, or the authorized representative is a PEP. This determination
must be made:
- At the establishment of the business relationship.
- Periodically during the relationship.
- Whenever there are indications of a change in PEP status.

Methods include internal and external database screening, media searches, and
direct inquiries to the customer.

7.3 Enhanced Due Diligence for PEPs (Art. 13-15 AMLO-FINMA)

Business relationships with PEPs are automatically classified as higher-risk.
The following enhanced measures apply:

(a) Senior management approval is required for the establishment and
    continuation of business relationships with PEPs.
(b) The source of wealth and the source of funds must be established.
(c) Enhanced ongoing monitoring must be conducted throughout the relationship.
(d) Periodic reviews must be performed at least annually (historically required
    annually; now part of a comprehensive periodic review framework following
    the 2023 AMLA revision).
(e) The business relationship must be documented in detail, including the
    rationale for maintaining the relationship.

7.4 Deactivation of PEP Status

A foreign PEP who has left a public function may be reclassified as non-PEP
after a waiting period, provided a risk assessment supports the reclassification.
The SBA and AMLO-FINMA do not prescribe a fixed waiting period but require
a documented risk-based assessment.

================================================================================
8. ENHANCED DUE DILIGENCE TRIGGERS AND PROCEDURES
================================================================================

8.1 Criteria for Higher-Risk Business Relationships (Art. 13 AMLO-FINMA)

Financial intermediaries must define internal criteria indicating business
relationships with higher risks (Art. 13 para. 1 AMLO-FINMA). The following
criteria are specified in AMLO-FINMA or must be considered:

(a) Domicile or business operations in a country designated by FATF as "High
    Risk" or "Non-cooperative."
(b) Business relationships with PEPs or their close associates.
(c) Complex structures involving domicile companies, particularly:
    - Domicile companies combined with other domicile companies.
    - Domicile companies combined with enterprises.
    - Domicile companies combined with shareholders holding shares on a
      fiduciary basis.
    - Structures in non-transparent jurisdictions.
    - Structures lacking reasonable business justification.
    - Structures created for short-term asset investments.
    Note: The combination of only two horizontal domicile companies may already
    suffice to constitute a complex structure classified as high-risk.
(d) Correspondent banking relationships (see Section 12).
(e) Cash-intensive businesses.
(f) Transactions with no apparent economic purpose.
(g) Unusual transaction patterns inconsistent with the customer profile.
(h) Business relationships involving countries with known deficiencies in AML
    controls as identified by FINMA communications.

8.2 Enhanced Due Diligence Procedures (Art. 15 AMLO-FINMA)

When a higher-risk business relationship or transaction is identified, the
financial intermediary must:

(a) Obtain additional information on the nature and purpose of the business
    relationship (Art. 15 para. 1 AMLO-FINMA).
(b) Gather information on the source of wealth and the source of funds.
(c) Check the plausibility of the information obtained and carefully document
    the results (Art. 15 para. 1 AMLO-FINMA).
(d) If increased risks are confirmed, apply extended clarification obligations
    (Art. 15 para. 2 AMLO-FINMA).
(e) Escalate to senior management or the AML compliance function for review
    and decision on the continuation of the business relationship.

Means of conducting enhanced due diligence include (Art. 16 AMLO-FINMA):
- Seeking oral or written explanations from the client or beneficial owner.
- Conducting on-site visits.
- Consulting publicly available sources and information.
- Making inquiries with reliable persons or sources.

================================================================================
9. SANCTIONS SCREENING OBLIGATIONS
================================================================================

9.1 Legal Basis

Financial intermediaries in Switzerland are subject to:
(a) The Federal Act on the Implementation of International Sanctions
    (Embargo Act, EmbA, SR 946.231).
(b) Specific sanctions ordinances adopted by the Federal Council implementing
    UN Security Council resolutions and autonomous Swiss sanctions.
(c) Art. 6 para. 2 lit. d AMLA, which requires reporting when customer data
    match terrorist lists provided by FINMA, the Federal Gaming Board, or SROs.

9.2 Screening Obligations

Financial intermediaries must:
- Screen all contracting parties, beneficial owners, and authorized
  representatives against applicable sanctions lists at the establishment
  of the business relationship.
- Conduct ongoing screening against updated sanctions lists.
- Screen against the SECO (State Secretariat for Economic Affairs) sanctions
  lists, which implement UN Security Council sanctions and Swiss autonomous
  sanctions.
- Screen against FINMA-communicated lists of designated persons and entities.

9.3 Consequences of a Match

If a match is detected:
- The financial intermediary must immediately freeze the assets in accordance
  with the applicable sanctions ordinance and Art. 10 AMLA.
- SECO must be notified without delay.
- The financial intermediary must not execute any transactions involving the
  frozen assets until instructed otherwise by SECO.
- A suspicious activity report to MROS may also be required depending on the
  circumstances.

================================================================================
10. TRANSACTION MONITORING REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================

10.1 General Obligation (Art. 20 AMLO-FINMA)

Financial intermediaries must monitor business relationships and transactions
to identify those involving increased risk. Art. 20 para. 2 AMLO-FINMA requires
banks and other larger financial intermediaries to operate a computer-based
(IT) transaction monitoring system.

10.2 Scope of Transaction Monitoring

The transaction monitoring system must be designed to detect:
(a) Transactions that are unusual in terms of their type, volume, or frequency
    relative to the customer's profile.
(b) Transactions with no apparent economic or lawful purpose.
(c) Patterns that may indicate money laundering, terrorist financing, or other
    criminal activity.
(d) Transactions involving high-risk countries or jurisdictions.
(e) Transactions exceeding certain thresholds as defined in internal policies.

10.3 Response to Alerts (Art. 20 para. 3 AMLO-FINMA)

When an alert is generated by the transaction monitoring system or otherwise,
the financial intermediary must:
(a) Conduct additional due diligence on the relevant business relationship or
    transaction without undue delay.
(b) Clarify the economic background and purpose of the transaction.
(c) Document the results of the clarification.
(d) Escalate to the AML compliance function if the clarification does not
    adequately resolve the concerns.
(e) Consider filing a suspicious activity report with MROS if a reasonable
    suspicion of money laundering or terrorist financing persists.

10.4 Calibration and Adequacy

The transaction monitoring system must be:
- Calibrated to the specific risk profile and business activities of the
  financial intermediary.
- Subject to regular review and recalibration to ensure continued
  effectiveness.
- Documented, with clear escalation procedures and thresholds defined in
  internal policies.

================================================================================
11. SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY REPORTING (SAR) TO MROS
================================================================================

11.1 Reporting Obligation (Art. 9 AMLA)

A financial intermediary must report to the Money Laundering Reporting Office
Switzerland (MROS) when it knows or has reasonable grounds to suspect that:

(a) Assets involved in a business relationship are the proceeds of a felony
    or a qualified tax misdemeanour (exceeding CHF 300,000 per tax period).
(b) Assets are connected to money laundering.
(c) Assets are connected to a criminal or terrorist organization.
(d) Assets serve to finance terrorism.
(e) Assets are subject to the power of disposal of a criminal or terrorist
    organization.

Note: There is no automatic reporting requirement for large cash transactions
in Switzerland (unlike some other jurisdictions). The reporting obligation is
triggered solely by reasonable suspicion.

11.2 Reporting Procedure

- Reports must be filed with MROS electronically through the goAML platform.
- The report must contain all information relevant to the suspicion, including
  customer identification data, details of the suspicious transactions, and
  the reasons for the suspicion.
- The financial intermediary must not inform the customer that a report has
  been filed (tipping-off prohibition).

11.3 Asset Freezing Upon Reporting (Art. 10 AMLA)

Upon filing a SAR, the financial intermediary must immediately freeze the
assets that are the subject of the report. The freeze remains in effect until
MROS or a prosecution authority issues further instructions, or until 5 working
days have elapsed without MROS forwarding the report to a prosecution authority.

11.4 Termination of Business Relationship

The financial intermediary may terminate a reported business relationship if
MROS fails to notify the intermediary within 40 working days that the
information has been forwarded to a prosecution authority. This 40-day
window was introduced in the 2021 AMLA revision.

11.5 Penalties for Non-Reporting

Failure to comply with the reporting obligation under Art. 9 AMLA constitutes
a criminal offence:
- Intentional non-reporting: Fines up to CHF 500,000.
- Negligent non-reporting: Fines up to CHF 150,000.

FINMA may additionally impose enforcement measures including occupational bans
of up to five years and confiscation of profits from supervisory violations.

================================================================================
12. CORRESPONDENT BANKING DUE DILIGENCE
================================================================================

12.1 Prohibition on Shell Bank Relationships (Art. 8b AMLO-FINMA)

Financial intermediaries are prohibited from establishing or maintaining
correspondent banking relationships with foreign shell banks that lack a
genuine physical presence and are not part of a consolidated supervised
financial group.

12.2 Enhanced Due Diligence for Correspondent Banking

Correspondent banking relationships are classified as higher-risk under
Art. 13 AMLO-FINMA. Financial intermediaries must:

(a) Gather sufficient information about the respondent institution to
    understand fully the nature of its business.
(b) Determine the reputation of the respondent institution and the quality
    of its supervision.
(c) Assess the respondent institution's AML/CFT controls.
(d) Obtain senior management approval for new correspondent banking
    relationships.
(e) Document the respective responsibilities of each institution.
(f) Ensure that the respondent institution has performed adequate CDD on
    its own customers having direct access to accounts of the correspondent.

12.3 Payable-Through Accounts

Financial intermediaries must exercise particular care with payable-through
accounts, ensuring that the respondent institution:
- Has verified the identity of, and performed ongoing due diligence on, the
  customers having direct access to the correspondent's accounts.
- Is able to provide relevant CDD information upon request.

================================================================================
13. RECORD KEEPING REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================

13.1 General Record-Keeping Obligation (Art. 7 AMLA)

Financial intermediaries must prepare supporting documents on the transactions
carried out and on the clarifications required under the AMLA in such a way
that competent third parties (including FINMA auditors and prosecution
authorities) can form a reliable judgment on:
(a) The transactions and business relationships.
(b) Compliance with AMLA obligations.

13.2 Retention Period

All AML-related records must be retained for at least 10 years after:
(a) Termination of the business relationship, or
(b) Completion of the transaction (for one-off transactions without a
    continuing business relationship).

This 10-year retention period applies to (Art. 7 para. 3 AMLA):
- Customer identification documents and copies.
- Beneficial ownership declarations (Forms A, K, R, S, T).
- Transaction records and supporting documentation.
- Results of due diligence inquiries and clarifications.
- Internal risk assessments and categorizations.
- Correspondence related to CDD and suspicious activity.
- Audio recordings from video identification procedures.
- Minutes and documentation of enhanced due diligence procedures.

13.3 Periodic Update of Records (Art. 7 para. 1bis AMLA)

Since the 2023 AMLA revision, financial intermediaries must periodically check
their records to ensure they are up to date and update them if necessary.
The periodicity, scope, and type of checking and updating must be based on
the risk posed by the customer (risk-based approach).

================================================================================
14. TRAINING AND AWARENESS OBLIGATIONS
================================================================================

14.1 General Training Requirement (Art. 23 AMLO-FINMA)

Financial intermediaries must ensure that their staff receive adequate training
on AML/CFT matters. Training must cover:

================================================================================
15. INTERNAL ORGANIZATION OF AML COMPLIANCE
================================================================================

15.1 AML Compliance Function (Art. 24-26 AMLO-FINMA)

Financial intermediaries must establish an adequate internal organization for
AML compliance, including:

(a) Designation of an AML Officer / AML Unit:
    - One or more qualified persons must be designated as the AML unit
      responsible for supporting and advising line managers and management in
      the implementation of the AMLO-FINMA (Art. 24 para. 1 AMLO-FINMA).
    - The AML unit must have sufficient independence, resources, and authority
      to perform its functions effectively.

(b) Internal Directives:
    - Financial intermediaries must issue internal directives covering all
      aspects of AML compliance, including risk criteria, CDD procedures,
      escalation processes, monitoring parameters, and reporting obligations
      (Art. 25 AMLO-FINMA).
    - Since the 2023 AMLA revision, internal directives must also address
      the criteria for risk-based, periodic checks to ensure customer data
      remain up to date.

(c) Risk Analysis (Art. 25 para. 2 AMLO-FINMA):
    - The financial intermediary must conduct and maintain a comprehensive AML
      risk analysis. This is an important tool for strategic management to
      identify and minimize risks, determine relevant risk criteria, and
      allocate resources appropriately.
    - The risk analysis must be updated periodically and whenever material
      changes occur in the business or risk environment.

15.2 Global Risk Management (Art. 6 AMLO-FINMA)

Financial intermediaries with foreign affiliates must establish robust oversight
mechanisms, including:

(a) An AML office or independent task force providing periodic risk analysis
    on a consolidated basis.
(b) Annual standardized reports on branches and group companies.
(c) Regular internal on-site inspections of foreign branches and group
    companies.
(d) Autonomous, timely notification from affiliates regarding substantial
    changes in legal or reputational risk.
(e) Sample preparation of individual business relationships for monitoring.

15.3 Internal Controls and Auditing

- The internal audit function or an equivalent body must periodically review
  the adequacy and effectiveness of AML controls.
- Statutory auditors review CDB compliance as part of their regulatory audit.
- FINMA may conduct direct on-site inspections of AML compliance.

================================================================================
16. RISK CATEGORIZATION OF BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS
================================================================================

16.1 Risk Categorization Framework (Art. 13 AMLO-FINMA)

Financial intermediaries must classify each business relationship according to
the risk of money laundering and terrorist financing. The classification
determines the level of due diligence and monitoring applied.

Typical risk categories include:
(a) Standard risk (normal due diligence).
(b) Higher risk (enhanced due diligence required).
(c) Prohibited (relationships that may not be established or must be
    terminated, e.g., shell banks).

16.2 Risk Factors

Risk categorization must take into account at least the following factors:

Country/geographic risk:
- FATF-designated high-risk or non-cooperative jurisdictions.
- Countries subject to sanctions.
- Countries with known deficiencies in AML/CFT systems.

Customer risk:
- PEP status.
- Complex or opaque ownership structures.
- Cash-intensive businesses.
- Non-profit organizations (specific terrorism financing risk).
- Virtual asset service providers.

Product/service risk:
- Products enabling anonymous transactions.
- Correspondent banking services.
- Private banking and wealth management.
- Trade finance.

Delivery channel risk:
- Non-face-to-face business relationships.
- Relationships established through intermediaries.

16.3 Documentation of Risk Categorization

The risk categorization of each business relationship must be documented and
maintained in the customer file. Changes in risk categorization must be
recorded with supporting rationale.

================================================================================
17. PERIODIC REVIEW REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================

17.1 2023 AMLA Revision: Mandatory Periodic Reviews

The 2023 AMLA revision introduced mandatory periodic reviews of all customer
data, irrespective of whether doubts or triggering events have arisen.
Previously, reviews occurred only when doubts emerged or, for PEPs, annually.

17.2 Risk-Based Frequency

The law mandates a risk-based approach to the frequency and scope of periodic
reviews:
- Higher-risk relationships: More frequent reviews (e.g., annually for PEPs,
  every 2-3 years for other higher-risk clients).
- Standard-risk relationships: Reviews at longer intervals. KYC questionnaires
  should typically be resubmitted every 7 to 10 years at a minimum.
- Lower-risk relationships: Less frequent reviews, though all relationships
  must be reviewed periodically.

17.3 Scope of Periodic Reviews

Periodic reviews should include:
(a) Verification that customer identification data remain current and accurate.
(b) Confirmation or update of beneficial ownership information.
(c) Review of the nature and purpose of the business relationship.
(d) Reassessment of the risk categorization.
(e) Review of transaction activity against the customer's profile.
(f) Screening against current sanctions lists and PEP databases.
(g) Update of internal documentation as necessary.

17.4 Trigger-Based Reviews (Art. 5 AMLA)

In addition to periodic reviews, financial intermediaries must renew
identification and CDD whenever:
- Doubts arise about the identity of the contracting party or beneficial owner.
- There are indications of material changes in the customer's circumstances.
- Unusual or suspicious transactions are detected.
- There is a change in applicable regulations or risk assessments.

================================================================================
18. ENFORCEMENT AND SUPERVISORY FRAMEWORK
================================================================================

18.1 FINMA Supervision

FINMA supervises AML compliance by prudentially regulated financial
intermediaries through:
- Regular regulatory audits conducted by licensed audit firms.
- Direct on-site inspections (particularly for higher-risk institutions or
  following material events).
- Review of audit reports and internal control assessments.
- Enforcement proceedings for identified violations.

18.2 Self-Regulatory Organizations (SROs)

Financial intermediaries not directly supervised by FINMA must affiliate with
a recognized SRO (e.g., VQF, PolyReg, OAR-G). SROs:
- Issue their own AML regulations, which must be consistent with AMLO-FINMA
  and approved by FINMA.
- Conduct audits of their affiliated members.
- Impose sanctions for non-compliance.
- Report material findings to FINMA.

18.3 Penalties and Enforcement Measures

FINMA has a range of enforcement tools:
- Administrative proceedings and orders.
- Publication of enforcement decisions ("naming and shaming").
- Occupational bans of up to five years.
- Confiscation of profits obtained through supervisory violations.
- Withdrawal of licenses in severe cases.

Criminal penalties under AMLA:
- Art. 37 AMLA: Intentional violation of reporting obligation — fine up to
  CHF 500,000.
- Art. 37 AMLA: Negligent violation — fine up to CHF 150,000.

Criminal penalties under SCC:
- Art. 305bis SCC: Money laundering — imprisonment of up to five years or
  a monetary penalty.
- Art. 305ter SCC: Insufficient diligence in financial transactions —
  imprisonment of up to one year or a monetary penalty.
