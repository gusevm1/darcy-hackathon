SWISS CAPITAL ADEQUACY ORDINANCE (CAO / ERV)
=============================================================
Eigenmittelverordnung (ERV), SR 952.03
Ordinance on Capital Adequacy and Risk Diversification for Banks
and Securities Firms of 1 June 2012 (as amended)

=============================================================
1. OVERVIEW AND LEGAL BASIS
=============================================================
The Swiss Capital Adequacy Ordinance (CAO), known in German as the
Eigenmittelverordnung (ERV), is the principal federal ordinance governing
capital adequacy and risk diversification for banks and securities firms
in Switzerland. Systematic reference number: SR 952.03.

The CAO is enacted pursuant to:
- Art. 4 BankA (SR 952.0): empowers the Federal Council to issue
  provisions on capital adequacy and risk diversification
- Art. 4bis BankA: requirements for systemically important banks
- Art. 50 FINMASA (SR 956.1): FINMA regulatory authority
Adopted 1 June 2012; most recently amended to implement the final
Basel III standards effective 1 January 2025.

Scope of application:
- Banks as defined under the Banking Act (BankA)
- Securities firms (formerly securities dealers)
- Financial groups and conglomerates (consolidated basis)
- Systemically important banks (enhanced requirements)

Purpose: ensure banks hold sufficient capital to limit their risks,
protecting creditors, depositors, and financial system stability.

3. MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS
=============================================================
Absolute minimum paid-in capital: CHF 10 million (Art. 3 para. 2
let. b BankA). FINMA may require higher amounts based on risk profile.

Risk-based capital ratios (Art. 41-42 CAO):
- Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1): minimum 4.5% of RWA
- Tier 1 capital (CET1 + AT1): minimum 6.0% of RWA
- Total capital (Tier 1 + Tier 2): minimum 8.0% of RWA
Compliance must be maintained continuously, not merely at reporting dates.

Total required capital = sum of capital for:
- Credit risk (Art. 49-75 CAO)
- Non-counterparty-related risk (Art. 76-78 CAO)
- Market risk (Art. 79-88 CAO)
- Operational risk (Art. 89-95 CAO)

=============================================================
4. ELIGIBLE CAPITAL COMPONENTS
=============================================================
4.1 Overview (Art. 16-17 CAO)
Total eligible capital = CET1 + AT1 + T2 (after regulatory deductions)

4.2 CET1 — Art. 18-21 CAO (highest-quality capital)
Components: paid-in share capital; share premium (Agio); disclosed
reserves; reserves for general banking risks (taxed and disclosed);
retained earnings (including audited interim profits net of foreseeable
dividends); minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries (Art. 22).
CET1 instruments must be the most subordinated claim in liquidation,
carry no fixed dividends, be perpetual, and absorb losses on a
going-concern basis.

4.3 AT1 — Art. 24-27 CAO
Criteria: perpetual (no fixed maturity); first call no earlier than
5 years; callable only with FINMA approval; loss-absorption via
(a) conversion into CET1 or (b) write-down of principal; trigger at
minimum 5.125% CET1 ratio (Art. 24) or FINMA non-viability
determination; coupon payments fully discretionary and non-cumulative.
Swiss AT1 "CoCos" for SIBs may have higher triggers (e.g., 7% CET1).

4.4 Tier 2 — Art. 28-30 CAO
Provides gone-concern loss absorption. Must have original maturity of
at least 5 years; no redemption incentive; callable after 5 years with
FINMA approval; subordinated to depositors and general creditors;
write-down/conversion mechanism on trigger event. Subject to straight-
line amortization of 20% per year during final 5 years before maturity.

4.5 Regulatory Deductions (Art. 31-40 CAO)
Deductions from CET1: goodwill and intangible assets (Art. 32);
deferred tax assets dependent on future profitability; cash flow hedge
reserves; IRB provision shortfalls; securitization gains on sale;
defined benefit pension fund net assets; reciprocal cross-holdings;
treasury shares; significant investments in financial institutions
(threshold deductions per Art. 35). Corresponding deduction rules
apply to AT1 and T2.

=============================================================
5. CREDIT RISK CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS
=============================================================
5.1 Framework (Art. 49-75 CAO)
Two approaches: (a) Swiss Standardized Approach (SA-BIS), Art. 50-62;
(b) Internal Ratings-Based Approach (IRB), Art. 63-75 (FINMA approval
required).

5.2 Standardized Approach (SA-BIS)
Key risk weights by exposure class:
- Sovereigns/central banks: Swiss Confederation and SNB 0%; others
  0%-150% based on rating
- Public sector entities: Swiss cantons 0% (with guarantee) or 20%;
  others 20%-150%
- Banks: rated 20%-150%; unrated 20%-50%
- Corporates: rated 20%-150%; unrated 100%; qualifying SMEs 85%
  (Basel III final 2025 revision)
- Retail: qualifying retail 75%
- Residential mortgages (2025 LTV-based weights):
  LTV up to 50%: 20%; 50-60%: 25%; 60-80%: 30%; 80-90%: 40%;
  90-100%: 50%; above 100%: 70%
  Own-use residential benefits from preferential treatment;
  investment properties attract higher weights
- Commercial real estate: 60%-150% depending on LTV and type
- Equities: listed 250%; unlisted 400%; speculative 1250%
- Cash/gold: 0%; fixed/other assets: 100%
- Past-due exposures: 100%-150%

5.3 Credit Risk Mitigation (Art. 56-61 CAO)
Recognized techniques: financial collateral (comprehensive and simple
approach); guarantees and credit derivatives; on-balance-sheet netting;
real estate collateral (specific valuation requirements). Comprehensive
approach applies regulatory haircuts for market, currency, and maturity
mismatch.

5.4 IRB Approach (Art. 63-75 CAO)
F-IRB: bank estimates PD; regulator sets LGD, EAD, M.
A-IRB: bank estimates PD, LGD, EAD, M.
Requirements: robust rating systems, 5-7 years historical data,
regular validation and back-testing, stress testing, annual FINMA review.

5.5 Output Floor (Basel III Final, effective 2025)
IRB-calculated RWA must be at least a percentage of SA-BIS RWA:
2025: 50%; 2026: 55%; 2027: 60%; 2028: 65%; 2029: 70%; 2030: 72.5%.

=============================================================
6. MARKET RISK CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS
=============================================================
6.1 Framework (Art. 79-88 CAO)
Covers interest rate, equity, FX, and commodity price risk for trading
book positions and FX/commodity positions across the balance sheet.

6.2 Trading Book Boundary (TBEO-FINMA, effective 2025)
Trading book positions must be held with trading intent; strict boundary
with documented transfers; replaced FINMA Circular 2013/1.

6.3 Standardized Approach
- Interest rate risk: maturity or duration method
- Equity risk: general (8%) and specific (4%-12%)
- FX risk: 8% on higher of net long or net short positions
- Commodity risk: simplified or maturity ladder approach

6.4 Internal Models Approach (IMA)
VaR: 99% confidence, 10-day holding period, 1-year minimum data,
multiplication factor minimum 3.0 with plus-factor for back-test
failures. The 2025 FRTB revision introduces Expected Shortfall (97.5%
confidence, varying horizons) and revised SA/IMA approaches.

6.5 CVA Risk
Capital for mark-to-market losses on OTC derivatives from counterparty
credit deterioration. SA-CVA and BA-CVA approaches available.

=============================================================
7. OPERATIONAL RISK CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS
=============================================================
7.1 Framework (Art. 89-95 CAO)
Operational risk: loss from inadequate or failed internal processes,
people, systems, or external events. Includes legal risk; excludes
strategic and reputational risk.

7.2 Pre-2025 Approaches (now superseded)
BIA: 15% of 3-year average gross income; TSA: 12%-18% by business
line; AMA: internal models with FINMA approval.

7.3 Standardized Measurement Approach (SMA) — Effective 2025
Specified in LROV-FINMA. Based on:
(a) Business Indicator Component (BIC): BI calculated from interest/
leasing/dividend, services, and financial components. Marginal
coefficients: BI up to EUR 1bn: 12%; EUR 1-30bn: 15%; above EUR 30bn:
18%.
(b) Internal Loss Multiplier (ILM): derived from historical loss
experience; adjusts BIC based on loss-to-BIC ratio; FINMA may set
ILM=1 for smaller institutions.
SMA capital = BIC x ILM. Loss data: minimum 10 years required.

=============================================================
8. CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER
=============================================================
Art. 43 CAO: 2.5% of RWA in CET1, above minimum ratios. Effective
CET1 requirement with buffer: 7.0% of RWA.

Distribution constraints when CET1 is within buffer range:
- 4.500%-5.125%: 0% distributions
- 5.125%-5.750%: up to 20%
- 5.750%-6.375%: up to 40%
- 6.375%-7.000%: up to 60%
- Above 7.000%: no constraint
Applies to dividends, buybacks, discretionary bonuses, AT1 coupons.

Category-specific buffers:
- Cat. 1 (G-SIBs): additional TLAC/gone-concern requirements
- Cat. 2 (D-SIBs): up to 4.0% CET1
- Cat. 3: up to 3.2% CET1
- Cat. 4-5: 2.5% standard (or SBR simplified regime)

=============================================================
9. COUNTERCYCLICAL CAPITAL BUFFER
=============================================================
Sectoral CCyB (Art. 44 CAO): up to 2.5% CET1 of RWA, activated by
Federal Council on SNB proposal. Currently set at 2.5% for mortgage
exposures secured by Swiss residential property. Activation/
deactivation follows macroeconomic and credit cycle conditions.

Extended CCyB: up to 2.5% CET1 for banks with total assets above
CHF 250 billion and significant foreign exposures.

=============================================================
10. LEVERAGE RATIO REQUIREMENTS
=============================================================
Minimum leverage ratio (Art. 46 CAO): 3.0%
Formula: Tier 1 Capital / Total Exposure Measure
Exposure measure: on-balance-sheet assets, derivative exposures
(SA-CCR), SFT exposures, off-balance-sheet items (with CCFs).
Detailed methodology in LROV-FINMA.

SIB requirements: D-SIBs 4.5%; G-SIBs up to 5.0%.
Small Banks Regime (SBR): simplified leverage ratio of at least 8.0%
replaces full risk-based requirements.

=============================================================
11. CAPITAL PLANNING AND ICAAP
=============================================================
Under FINMA Circular 2017/1 "Corporate Governance — Banks,"
institutions must maintain a robust ICAAP covering Pillar 2 risks.

ICAAP requirements: identify/measure all material risks (including
concentration, IRRBB, strategic risk); define internal capital
exceeding regulatory minimums; forward-looking capital planning
(3-5 years); stress testing and scenario analysis; annual board review.

Stress testing: macroeconomic downturn, market stress, idiosyncratic
events, reverse stress testing. Results inform planning and are
reported to FINMA upon request.

Pillar 2 add-ons: FINMA may impose institution-specific capital
requirements based on ICAAP quality, risk concentrations, IRRBB,
model risk, governance deficiencies. Communicated via assessment letters.

=============================================================
12. BASEL III IMPLEMENTATION IN SWITZERLAND
=============================================================
Historical timeline: Basel III capital requirements effective 2013
(phase-in through 2019); leverage ratio binding 2018; LCR 2015;
NSFR 2021.

Basel III Final (Basel 3.1) effective 1 January 2025:
- Revised SA-BIS: granular risk weights, LTV-based real estate, new
  exposure classes
- Output floor (50% in 2025, rising to 72.5% by 2030)
- SMA replaces AMA for operational risk
- FRTB for market risk
- Revised CVA, SA-CCR, leverage ratio exposure measurement

Five FINMA implementing ordinances (effective 1 January 2025):
1. CreO-FINMA (credit risks) — replaces Circular 2017/7
2. MarO-FINMA (market risks) — replaces Circular 2008/20
3. TBEO-FINMA (trading/banking book, eligible capital) — replaces
   Circular 2013/1
4. LROV-FINMA (leverage ratio, operational risks) — replaces Circulars
   2015/3 and 2008/21
5. DisO-FINMA (disclosure) — replaces Circular 2016/1

Swiss finish: higher CoCo triggers (7%/5% CET1 for SIBs); stricter
SIB leverage ratios; sectoral CCyB; conservative property revaluation
(every 5 years); gone-concern capacity for SIBs.

=============================================================
13. FINMA SUPERVISORY CATEGORIES
=============================================================
FINMA classifies banks into five categories based on total assets,
assets under management, privileged deposits, and required capital.

Category 1 — G-SIBs (e.g., UBS):
Going-concern: up to 14.3% RWA, leverage up to 5.0%.
Gone-concern: 100% of going-concern (bail-in bonds/TLAC).
FINMA may grant rebates for improved resolvability.

Category 2 — D-SIBs (PostFinance, Raiffeisen, ZKB):
Going-concern: up to 12.86% RWA, leverage 4.5%.
Gone-concern: 40% of going-concern (bail-in debt).

Category 3 — Large banks (total assets >CHF 15bn):
8% total capital, buffer up to 3.2% CET1, leverage 3.0%.
Preventive supervision with regular on-site inspections.

Category 4 — Medium banks (CHF 1-15bn):
8% total capital, 2.5% buffer, leverage 3.0%.
Event-driven supervision. SBR eligible if qualifying.

Category 5 — Small banks (up to ~CHF 1bn):
Standard minimums or Small Banks Regime (SBR) per Art. 47a-47e.
SBR eligibility: simplified leverage ratio >=8.0%; refinancing ratio
>=100%; average LCR >=110% (12-month assessment).
SBR benefits: no RWA calculation; no capital buffer/CCyB calculations;
no NSFR; simplified circulars; reduced reporting/disclosure.
~55 institutions in SBR as of end-2024.

Large exposure limits (Art. 96-112 CAO): max 25% of Tier 1 capital
per counterparty. SIBs: max 15% for exposures to other SIBs.
Exemptions: Swiss Confederation/SNB exposures, short-term interbank,
