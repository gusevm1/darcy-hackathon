SWISS CAPITAL ADEQUACY ORDINANCE (CAO / ERV)
=============================================================
Eigenmittelverordnung (ERV), SR 952.03
Ordinance on Capital Adequacy and Risk Diversification for Banks
and Securities Firms of 1 June 2012 (as amended)

=============================================================
1. OVERVIEW AND LEGAL BASIS
=============================================================

The Swiss Capital Adequacy Ordinance (CAO), known in German as the
Eigenmittelverordnung (ERV), is the principal federal ordinance governing
the capital adequacy and risk diversification requirements for banks and
securities firms in Switzerland. It bears the systematic reference
number SR 952.03.

The CAO is enacted pursuant to:
- Art. 4 of the Federal Act on Banks and Savings Banks (Banking Act,
  BankA, SR 952.0), which empowers the Federal Council to issue
  provisions on capital adequacy and risk diversification
- Art. 4bis BankA, which addresses requirements for systemically
  important banks
- Art. 50 of the Financial Market Supervision Act (FINMASA, SR 956.1)

The ordinance was adopted by the Federal Council on 1 June 2012 and has
been subject to multiple amendments, most recently to implement the
final Basel III standards effective 1 January 2025.

The CAO applies to:
- Banks as defined under the Banking Act (BankA)
- Securities firms (formerly securities dealers)
- Financial groups and conglomerates on a consolidated basis
- Systemically important banks (with enhanced requirements)

The overarching purpose of the CAO is to ensure that banks hold
sufficient capital to adequately limit their risks, thereby protecting
creditors, depositors, and the stability of the Swiss financial system.

=============================================================

=============================================================
3. MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS
=============================================================

3.1 Absolute Minimum Capital
-----------------------------
Under Art. 3 para. 2 let. b BankA, every bank in Switzerland must
maintain a fully paid-in minimum capital of CHF 10 million. FINMA may
require higher minimum capital depending on the scope, complexity, and
risk profile of a bank's activities.

3.2 Risk-Based Capital Ratios (Art. 41-42 CAO)
-----------------------------------------------
Banks must hold sufficient eligible capital to cover the risks arising
from their business activities. The minimum capital ratios, expressed
as a percentage of risk-weighted assets (RWA), are:

- Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1):  minimum 4.5% of RWA
- Tier 1 capital (CET1 + AT1):  minimum 6.0% of RWA
- Total capital (Tier 1 + Tier 2): minimum 8.0% of RWA

These ratios correspond to the Basel III minimums and are specified in
Art. 42 CAO. Banks must demonstrate compliance on a continuous basis,
not merely at reporting dates.

3.3 Calculation of Required Capital (Art. 42 CAO)
---------------------------------------------------
The total required capital is calculated as the sum of:
- Capital required for credit risk (Art. 49-75 CAO)
- Capital required for non-counterparty-related risk (Art. 76-78 CAO)
- Capital required for market risk (Art. 79-88 CAO)
- Capital required for operational risk (Art. 89-95 CAO)

The resulting aggregate constitutes the total risk-weighted positions
(Gesamtrisikopositionen), against which minimum capital ratios are
measured.

=============================================================
4. ELIGIBLE CAPITAL COMPONENTS
=============================================================

4.1 Overview (Art. 16-17 CAO)
------------------------------
Eligible regulatory capital consists of two main tiers:
- Tier 1 Capital (T1), which subdivides into:
  - Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1)
  - Additional Tier 1 (AT1)
- Tier 2 Capital (T2)

Total eligible capital = CET1 + AT1 + T2 (after regulatory deductions)

4.2 Common Equity Tier 1 Capital (CET1) — Art. 18-21 CAO
----------------------------------------------------------
CET1 is the highest-quality component of regulatory capital. It
consists of:
- Paid-in share capital (Gesellschaftskapital) — common shares for
  corporations (AG), or equivalent capital for cooperatives and
  cantonal banks organized under public law
- Share premium (Agio) from the issuance of CET1 instruments
- Disclosed reserves (offene Reserven)
- Reserves for general banking risks (Reserven fuer allgemeine
  Bankrisiken), provided they are taxed and disclosed
- Retained earnings (Gewinnvortrag), including audited interim profits
  net of foreseeable dividends
- Minority interests in CET1 of consolidated subsidiaries (subject to
  restrictions per Art. 22 CAO)

CET1 instruments must:
- Represent the most subordinated claim in liquidation
- Carry no fixed or mandatory dividends
- Be perpetual with no maturity date or redemption incentive
- Absorb losses on a going-concern basis

4.3 Additional Tier 1 Capital (AT1) — Art. 24-27 CAO
------------------------------------------------------
AT1 instruments supplement CET1 and must meet stringent criteria:
- Perpetual with no fixed maturity date
- First call option no earlier than 5 years after issuance
- Callable only with prior FINMA approval
- Contain a loss-absorption mechanism: either
  (a) Contractual conversion into CET1 (equity conversion), or
  (b) Contractual write-down of principal
- The trigger event is specified as a decline of the CET1 ratio below
  a predefined threshold (minimum 5.125% per Art. 24 CAO) or a
  determination of non-viability by FINMA
- Must not contain features that could hinder recapitalization
- Coupon payments are fully discretionary and non-cumulative

Swiss AT1 instruments (often referred to as "CoCos" — contingent
convertible bonds) may be issued with higher trigger thresholds
(e.g., 7% CET1 for systemically important banks).

4.4 Tier 2 Capital (T2) — Art. 28-30 CAO
------------------------------------------
Tier 2 capital provides supplementary loss absorption, primarily in
a gone-concern (resolution) scenario. T2 instruments must:
- Have an original maturity of at least 5 years
- Contain no incentive to redeem (e.g., step-up coupons are restricted)
- Be callable only after a minimum of 5 years, with FINMA approval
- Be subordinated to all depositors and general creditors
- Include a loss-absorption mechanism (write-down or conversion) upon
  the occurrence of a trigger event or non-viability determination

Tier 2 capital is subject to amortization: during the final 5 years
before maturity, Tier 2 instruments are progressively reduced in
recognized value (straight-line amortization of 20% per year).

4.5 Regulatory Deductions (Art. 31-40 CAO)
--------------------------------------------
The CAO mandates specific deductions from capital components to ensure
that only genuine loss-absorbing capital is recognized:

Deductions from CET1 include:
- Goodwill and other intangible assets (Art. 32 CAO)
- Deferred tax assets dependent on future profitability (Art. 32 CAO)
- Cash flow hedge reserves related to items not measured at fair value
- Shortfall of provisions relative to expected losses (IRB banks)
- Gains on sale related to securitization transactions
- Defined benefit pension fund assets (net of associated deferred tax)
- Reciprocal cross-holdings in CET1 instruments
- Investments in own CET1 instruments (treasury shares)
- Significant investments in the capital of financial institutions
  (subject to threshold deductions per Art. 35 CAO)

Corresponding deduction rules apply to AT1 and T2 capital for holdings
of AT1 and T2 instruments of other financial institutions.

=============================================================
5. CREDIT RISK CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS
=============================================================

5.1 General Framework (Art. 49-75 CAO)
----------------------------------------
Credit risk is defined as the risk of loss arising from a counterparty's
failure to meet its obligations or from a reduction in the value of
financial instruments issued by a third party. Banks must hold capital
against credit risk for all on-balance-sheet exposures and off-balance-
sheet commitments.

Two principal approaches are available:
(a) The Swiss Standardized Approach (SA-BIS) — Art. 50-62 CAO
(b) The Internal Ratings-Based Approach (IRB) — Art. 63-75 CAO

Banks using the IRB approach require prior FINMA authorization.

5.2 Standardized Approach (SA-BIS) — Art. 50-62 CAO
-----------------------------------------------------
Under the SA-BIS approach, exposures are assigned to defined exposure
classes, each with prescribed risk weights. The key exposure classes
and their risk weights are:

Sovereign and central bank exposures:
- Swiss Confederation and SNB: 0%
- Other sovereigns: 0% to 150%, based on external credit rating

Public sector entities (cantons, municipalities):
- Swiss cantons and municipalities: 0% (with cantonal guarantee) or 20%
- Other public entities: 20% to 150%, based on rating

Multilateral development banks: 0% to 50%

Bank exposures:
- Rated banks: 20% to 150%, depending on external rating
- Unrated banks: 20% to 50%, depending on jurisdiction and maturity

Corporate exposures:
- Rated corporates: 20% to 150%, based on external credit rating
- Unrated corporates: 100% (standard risk weight)
- SME preferential treatment: 85% for qualifying small and medium
  enterprises (per Basel III final revisions, effective 2025)

Retail exposures:
- Qualifying retail: 75% risk weight
- This includes exposures to natural persons or small businesses
  meeting granularity and size criteria

Residential mortgage exposures:
- Risk weight depends on loan-to-value (LTV) ratio:
  - LTV up to 50%: 20% risk weight (effective 2025 revision)
  - LTV 50-60%: 25%
  - LTV 60-80%: 30%
  - LTV 80-90%: 40%
  - LTV 90-100%: 50%
  - LTV above 100%: 70%
- Own-use residential property benefits from preferential treatment
- Investment properties generally attract higher risk weights

Commercial real estate exposures:
- Risk weight of 60% to 150% depending on LTV and property type
- Exposures secured by income-producing real estate (IPRE) are
  subject to specific treatment under the 2025 revisions

Equity exposures:
- Listed equities: 250%
- Unlisted equities: 400%
- Speculative equity investments: 1250%

Other assets:
- Cash and gold: 0%
- Fixed assets, other assets: 100%
- Past-due exposures: 100% to 150%, depending on specific provisions

5.3 Credit Risk Mitigation (Art. 56-61 CAO)
---------------------------------------------
The CAO recognizes several credit risk mitigation techniques:
- Financial collateral (comprehensive and simple approach)
- Guarantees and credit derivatives
- On-balance-sheet netting
- Real estate collateral (with specific valuation requirements)

Under the comprehensive approach, collateral values are adjusted using
regulatory haircuts to account for market risk, currency mismatch,
and maturity mismatch.

5.4 Internal Ratings-Based Approach (IRB) — Art. 63-75 CAO
------------------------------------------------------------
Banks with FINMA approval may use internal models to estimate:
- Probability of default (PD)
- Loss given default (LGD) — under A-IRB (Advanced IRB)
- Exposure at default (EAD) — under A-IRB
- Effective maturity (M) — under A-IRB

Under the Foundation IRB (F-IRB), banks estimate only PD; LGD, EAD,
and M are set by the regulator.

The IRB approach requires:
- Robust rating systems with clearly defined rating grades
- A minimum of 5-7 years of historical data
- Regular validation and back-testing
- Stress testing of credit portfolios
- Annual FINMA review and approval

5.5 Output Floor (Basel III Final, effective 2025)
----------------------------------------------------
Following the Basel III finalization, the CAO introduces an output
floor that limits the capital benefit from using internal models:

- Risk-weighted assets calculated under the IRB approach must be at
  least a specified percentage of the RWA that would result from
  the standardized approach (SA-BIS)
- Phase-in schedule:
  - 1 January 2025: 50%
  - 1 January 2026: 55%
  - 1 January 2027: 60%
  - 1 January 2028: 65%
  - 1 January 2029: 70%
  - 1 January 2030: 72.5% (fully phased in)

This ensures that internal models do not produce capital requirements
that are less than 72.5% of those under the standardized approach.

=============================================================
6. MARKET RISK CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS
=============================================================

6.1 General Framework (Art. 79-88 CAO)
----------------------------------------
Market risk is the risk of loss from changes in market prices,
including interest rates, equity prices, foreign exchange rates, and
commodity prices. Banks must hold capital for market risk in respect
of positions held in the trading book, as well as foreign exchange and
commodity positions across the entire balance sheet.

6.2 Trading Book and Banking Book (TBEO-FINMA)
------------------------------------------------
The allocation of positions between the trading book and banking book
is governed by the FINMA Trading Book and Banking Book Ordinance
(TBEO-FINMA), which replaced FINMA Circular 2013/1 effective
1 January 2025. Key principles include:
- Trading book positions must be held with trading intent or to hedge
  other trading book positions
- Strict boundary: transfers between books require documentation and
  FINMA notification; capital impact of transfers must be reported
- Presumption of trading book allocation for specific instruments

6.3 Standardized Approach for Market Risk
-------------------------------------------
Under the standardized approach, capital requirements for market risk
are calculated by summing the requirements for each risk factor:

- Interest rate risk: general and specific risk charges based on
  maturity method or duration method
- Equity risk: general market risk (8%) and specific risk (4%-12%
  depending on diversification and listing)
- Foreign exchange risk: shorthand method based on overall net open
  position; 8% capital charge on the higher of aggregate net long
  or net short positions
- Commodity risk: simplified approach or maturity ladder approach

6.4 Internal Models Approach (IMA)
------------------------------------
Banks with FINMA authorization may use internal models (Value-at-Risk
and Expected Shortfall models) to calculate market risk capital:
- Confidence level: 99% (VaR) / 97.5% (ES under revised framework)
- Holding period: 10 trading days (VaR) / varying horizons (ES)
- Observation period: minimum 1 year of historical data
- Multiplication factor: minimum 3.0, subject to increase based on
  back-testing results (plus-factor mechanism)
- Stressed VaR / Stressed ES requirements
- Model validation and FINMA approval required

The 2025 revisions implement the Fundamental Review of the Trading
Book (FRTB), introducing the revised standardized approach (SA) and
revised internal models approach (IMA) for market risk.

6.5 Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) Risk
--------------------------------------------
Banks must hold capital for CVA risk — the risk of mark-to-market
losses on OTC derivatives due to deterioration in counterparty
creditworthiness. The CAO provides for:
- Standardized CVA approach (SA-CVA)
- Basic CVA approach (BA-CVA)
- Exemptions for certain smaller exposures

=============================================================
7. OPERATIONAL RISK CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS
=============================================================

7.1 General Framework (Art. 89-95 CAO)
----------------------------------------
Operational risk is defined as the risk of loss resulting from
inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems, or from
external events. This includes legal risk but excludes strategic and
reputational risk.

7.2 Approaches for Calculating Operational Risk Capital
---------------------------------------------------------
Prior to 2025, the CAO provided three approaches:
- Basic Indicator Approach (BIA): 15% of average gross income over
  three years
- Standardized Approach (TSA): weighted average of gross income by
  business line (12%-18%)
- Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA): internal models with FINMA
  approval

7.3 Standardized Measurement Approach (SMA) — Effective 2025
--------------------------------------------------------------
With the implementation of the final Basel III standards, the CAO
replaces the previous approaches with the Standardized Measurement
Approach (SMA), as specified in the FINMA Leverage Ratio and
Operational Risks Ordinance (LROV-FINMA):

The SMA is based on:
(a) Business Indicator Component (BIC):
    - The Business Indicator (BI) is calculated from financial
      statement items: interest, leasing and dividend component;
      services component; and financial component
    - The BIC applies marginal coefficients to the BI:
      - BI up to EUR 1 billion: coefficient of 12%
      - BI EUR 1-30 billion: coefficient of 15%
      - BI above EUR 30 billion: coefficient of 18%

(b) Internal Loss Multiplier (ILM):
    - Derived from a bank's actual historical loss experience
    - Banks must maintain comprehensive internal loss databases
    - The ILM adjusts the BIC upward or downward based on the
      ratio of average historical losses to the BIC
    - FINMA may set the ILM to 1 for smaller institutions

The SMA capital requirement = BIC x ILM

Banks must maintain detailed loss data records covering at least 10
years, including loss amounts, recovery amounts, dates, business lines,
and event types. The data must be regularly validated.

=============================================================
8. CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER
=============================================================

8.1 Requirement (Art. 43 CAO)
-------------------------------
All banks must maintain a capital conservation buffer (Eigenmittel-
puffer) of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets, to be held entirely in
CET1 capital. This buffer sits above the minimum capital ratios.

Combined with the minimum CET1 ratio of 4.5%, the effective CET1
requirement including the buffer is 7.0% of RWA.

8.2 Buffer Distribution Constraints
--------------------------------------
When a bank's CET1 capital falls within the buffer range (i.e.,
between 4.5% and 7.0% of RWA), automatic constraints on capital
distributions apply:

CET1 ratio range          Maximum distribution (% of earnings)
4.500% - 5.125%           0% (no distributions permitted)
5.125% - 5.750%           Up to 20%
5.750% - 6.375%           Up to 40%
6.375% - 7.000%           Up to 60%
Above 7.000%              No constraint

Capital distributions subject to restriction include:
- Dividend payments
- Share buybacks
- Discretionary bonus payments
- AT1 coupon payments (to the extent discretionary)

8.3 Category-Specific Buffer Requirements
-------------------------------------------
The capital buffer varies by FINMA supervisory category:
- Category 1 banks (G-SIBs): subject to additional TLAC and
  gone-concern requirements (see Section 13)
- Category 2 banks (D-SIBs): buffer of up to 4.0% CET1 of RWA
- Category 3 banks: buffer of up to 3.2% CET1 of RWA
- Category 4 banks: 2.5% standard buffer
- Category 5 banks: 2.5% standard buffer (or simplified regime)

=============================================================
9. COUNTERCYCLICAL CAPITAL BUFFER
=============================================================

9.1 Sectoral Countercyclical Buffer (Art. 44 CAO)
---------------------------------------------------
The Federal Council, upon proposal by the Swiss National Bank (SNB),
may activate a sectoral countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) of up
to 2.5% of risk-weighted positions in CET1 capital.

The CCyB is targeted at excessive credit growth in specific sectors
and is currently applied to mortgage-backed exposures secured by
Swiss residential property. As of the most recent activation, the
sectoral CCyB stands at 2.5% for such exposures.

Key features:
- Activation and deactivation by Federal Council decision
- Applies to specific exposure classes (currently residential
  mortgage lending in Switzerland)
- Must be held in CET1 capital
- The SNB monitors credit market conditions and makes recommendations
- Buffer may be adjusted (increased, decreased, or deactivated)
  depending on macroeconomic and credit cycle conditions

9.2 Extended Countercyclical Buffer
--------------------------------------
An extended countercyclical buffer of up to 2.5% CET1 of RWA may be
imposed on banks with total assets exceeding CHF 250 billion and
significant foreign exposures, to address systemic risks arising from
international lending activities.

=============================================================
10. LEVERAGE RATIO REQUIREMENTS
=============================================================

10.1 Minimum Leverage Ratio (Art. 46 CAO)
-------------------------------------------
All banks must maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 3.0%, calculated
as:

Leverage Ratio = Tier 1 Capital / Total Exposure Measure

The leverage ratio serves as a non-risk-weighted backstop to the
risk-based capital requirements, preventing excessive leverage
regardless of the risk weight assigned to assets.

10.2 Total Exposure Measure
------------------------------
The total exposure measure includes:
- On-balance-sheet assets (excluding deductions from Tier 1 capital)
- Derivative exposures (using SA-CCR or simplified methodology)
- Securities financing transaction (SFT) exposures
- Off-balance-sheet items (applying credit conversion factors)

The detailed calculation methodology is specified in the FINMA
Leverage Ratio and Operational Risks Ordinance (LROV-FINMA).

10.3 Leverage Ratio for Systemically Important Banks
------------------------------------------------------
Systemically important banks are subject to enhanced leverage ratio
requirements:
- Minimum going-concern leverage ratio: 4.5% for domestic SIBs
- Higher requirements for G-SIBs based on systemic importance score
- Gone-concern leverage ratio requirements are calibrated relative
  to going-concern requirements

10.4 Small Banks Regime (SBR)
-------------------------------
Banks qualifying for the Small Banks Regime (SBR) under Art. 47a-47e
CAO are subject to a simplified leverage ratio of at least 8.0%
instead of the full risk-based capital requirements. This regime
eliminates the need to calculate RWA, capital buffers, and the
sectoral countercyclical buffer for qualifying institutions.

=============================================================
11. CAPITAL PLANNING AND ICAAP
=============================================================

11.1 Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP)
-----------------------------------------------------------
Under FINMA supervisory expectations, particularly FINMA Circular
2017/1 "Corporate Governance — Banks," institutions must maintain
a robust ICAAP. While the CAO itself prescribes the minimum
regulatory capital (Pillar 1), the ICAAP encompasses a comprehensive
assessment of all material risks (Pillar 2).

The ICAAP must:
- Identify and measure all material risks, including those not fully
  captured under Pillar 1 (e.g., concentration risk, interest rate
  risk in the banking book, strategic risk)
- Define an appropriate level of internal capital (economic capital)
  that exceeds regulatory minimums by an adequate margin
- Include forward-looking capital planning over a multi-year horizon
  (typically 3-5 years)
- Incorporate stress testing and scenario analysis
- Be reviewed and approved by the board of directors at least annually

11.2 Stress Testing
---------------------
Banks are required to conduct regular stress tests covering:
- Macroeconomic downturn scenarios
- Severe but plausible market stress events
- Idiosyncratic stress (bank-specific events)
- Reverse stress testing (identifying scenarios that would deplete
  capital below minimum requirements)

Results must inform capital planning decisions and be reported to
FINMA upon request.

11.3 Supervisory Review Process (Pillar 2)
--------------------------------------------
FINMA may impose institution-specific capital add-ons (Pillar 2
requirements) based on its assessment of:
- The quality and effectiveness of the ICAAP
- Risk concentrations
- Interest rate risk in the banking book
- Model risk (for IRB and IMA banks)
- Governance and risk management deficiencies
- Other institution-specific risk factors

These add-ons are communicated through FINMA assessment letters
and are binding on the institution.

=============================================================
12. BASEL III IMPLEMENTATION IN SWITZERLAND
=============================================================

12.1 Historical Context
-------------------------
Switzerland was an early adopter of the Basel III framework:
- Basel III capital requirements (CET1, AT1, T2, buffers): effective
  1 January 2013, with phase-in through 2019
- Leverage ratio disclosure: effective 2015; binding minimum: 2018
- Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR): effective 2015
- Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR): effective 2021

12.2 Basel III Final (Basel 3.1) — Effective 1 January 2025
--------------------------------------------------------------
The Federal Council revised the CAO to implement the final Basel III
standards (published by the BCBS in December 2017 and January 2019):

Key changes effective 1 January 2025:
- Revised Standardized Approach for Credit Risk (SA-BIS): more
  granular risk weights, LTV-based treatment for real estate, new
  exposure classes
- Introduction of the output floor (50%, rising to 72.5% by 2030)
- Replacement of the Advanced Measurement Approach for operational
  risk with the Standardized Measurement Approach (SMA)
- Revised market risk framework based on the Fundamental Review of
  the Trading Book (FRTB)
- Revised CVA risk framework
- Updated leverage ratio exposure measurement
- Revised standardized approach for counterparty credit risk (SA-CCR)

12.3 FINMA Implementing Ordinances (Effective 1 January 2025)
---------------------------------------------------------------
FINMA issued five ordinances to implement the revised CAO:

1. FINMA Ordinance on Credit Risks (CreO-FINMA)
   - Replaces FINMA Circular 2017/7 "Credit risks — banks"
   - Details SA-BIS risk weights, IRB requirements, CVA calculations

2. FINMA Ordinance on Market Risks (MarO-FINMA)
   - Replaces FINMA Circular 2008/20 "Market risks — banks"
   - Implements revised standardized and model approaches for market
     risk under the FRTB

3. FINMA Ordinance on Trading Book and Banking Book and Eligible
   Capital (TBEO-FINMA)
   - Replaces FINMA Circular 2013/1 "Eligible capital — banks"
   - Defines trading/banking book boundary, transfer rules, and
     eligible capital classification

4. FINMA Ordinance on Leverage Ratio and Operational Risks
   (LROV-FINMA)
   - Replaces FINMA Circular 2015/3 "Leverage ratio — banks" and
     portions of Circular 2008/21 "Operational risks — banks"
   - Specifies leverage ratio exposure calculations and SMA for
     operational risk

5. FINMA Ordinance on Disclosure Obligations (DisO-FINMA)
   - Replaces FINMA Circular 2016/1 "Disclosure — banks"
   - Defines updated disclosure tables on capital, risk, and other
     prudential metrics

12.4 Swiss Finish
-------------------
Switzerland has traditionally applied requirements that exceed the
Basel minimums (the so-called "Swiss finish"). Key examples include:
- Higher trigger thresholds for AT1 and T2 instruments (7% and 5%
  CET1 respectively for systemically important banks)
- More stringent leverage ratio requirements for SIBs
- The sectoral countercyclical buffer for residential mortgages
- More conservative real estate valuation rules (revaluation every
  5 years under the 2025 revisions)
- Additional gone-concern loss-absorbing capacity for SIBs

=============================================================
13. FINMA SUPERVISORY CATEGORIES AND CATEGORY-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS
=============================================================

FINMA classifies all supervised banks and securities firms into five
supervisory categories based on measurable criteria: total assets,
assets under management, privileged deposits, and required capital.
The categorization determines the intensity of supervision and
certain regulatory requirements.

13.1 Category 1 — Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Criteria: Extremely large, systemically important, and complex
institutions with very high risk profiles.
Current institutions: UBS Group AG (following the CS acquisition)

Capital requirements (going concern):
- Base: 4.5% CET1 + 1.5% AT1 = 6.0% Tier 1 (minimum)
- Buffer: 8.5% of RWA (at least 5.5% in CET1, remainder in high-
  trigger CoCos)
- Additional surcharge based on systemic importance score
- Total going-concern capital: up to 14.3% of RWA
- Going-concern leverage ratio: up to 5.0%

Gone-concern requirements:
- 100% of going-concern requirements (i.e., matching amount)
- Fulfilled primarily through bail-in bonds (TLAC-eligible debt)
- FINMA may grant rebates for demonstrably improved resolvability

13.2 Category 2 — Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Criteria: Very important and complex institutions with high risk
profiles.

14. RISK DIVERSIFICATION (LARGE EXPOSURES)
=============================================================

14.1 General Rule (Art. 96-112 CAO)
--------------------------------------
Banks must diversify their risks and avoid excessive concentration of
exposures to individual counterparties or groups of connected
counterparties. The standard large exposure limit is:

- Maximum 25% of adjusted Tier 1 capital per counterparty or group
  of connected counterparties (Art. 97 CAO)

14.2 Enhanced Limits for SIBs
-------------------------------
Systemically important banks are subject to a tighter concentration
limit:
- Maximum 15% of Tier 1 capital for exposures to other systemically
  important banks or financial institutions

14.3 Exemptions and Special Treatments
-----------------------------------------
Certain exposures are exempt or subject to preferential treatment:
- Exposures to the Swiss Confederation and SNB: exempt
- Interbank exposures with maturities under 100 days: partially
  exempt
- Covered bonds under specific conditions
- Exposures within a financial group (intra-group exemptions,
  subject to conditions)

=============================================================
15. REPORTING AND DISCLOSURE OBLIGATIONS
=============================================================

15.1 Capital Adequacy Reporting to SNB (Art. 47a ff. CAO)
-----------------------------------------------------------
Banks must submit capital adequacy reports to the Swiss National Bank
(SNB) at regular intervals:
- Quarterly reporting of capital ratios, RWA, leverage ratio, and
  liquidity metrics
- Semi-annual consolidated capital statements for groups
- The reporting framework was updated effective 1 January 2025 to
  reflect the revised Basel III standards

The SNB collects data on behalf of FINMA and publishes aggregate
statistics.

15.2 Public Disclosure Obligations (DisO-FINMA)
--------------------------------------------------
Banks must publicly disclose information on their capital adequacy,
risk profile, and risk management practices. The disclosure
obligations are specified in the FINMA Ordinance on Disclosure
Obligations (DisO-FINMA), which replaced FINMA Circular 2016/1
effective 1 January 2025.

Disclosure requirements include:
- Key Metrics Table (KM1): overview of capital ratios, leverage
  ratio, LCR, and NSFR
- Composition of regulatory capital (CC1, CC2 tables)
- Risk-weighted assets by risk category
- Credit risk exposures and risk weights (CR tables)
- Market risk capital requirements
- Operational risk capital requirements
- Leverage ratio detailed breakdown (LR tables)
- Liquidity metrics (LIQ tables)
- Remuneration disclosures for significant institutions

Disclosure frequency varies by supervisory category:
- Category 1-2 banks: quarterly or semi-annual disclosure
- Category 3 banks: semi-annual disclosure
- Category 4 banks: annual disclosure
- Category 5 banks / SBR institutions: annual disclosure of key
  metrics (KM1) only

15.3 Ad Hoc Disclosure
-------------------------
Banks must disclose material events that may significantly affect
their capital adequacy or risk profile on a timely basis. FINMA may
require additional disclosures in specific circumstances.

=============================================================
16. TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS
=============================================================

16.1 Basel III Final Phase-In (2025-2030)
-------------------------------------------
The 2025 revision of the CAO includes transitional provisions to
allow banks to adapt to the new requirements:

Output floor phase-in:
- 2025: 50%
- 2026: 55%
- 2027: 60%
- 2028: 65%
- 2029: 70%
- 2030: 72.5% (fully phased in)

Credit risk revised standardized approach:
- New risk weights for real estate exposures apply immediately from
  1 January 2025
- Revaluation of real estate collateral: banks must complete
  revaluation within 5 years of the effective date

Operational risk (SMA):
- The Standardized Measurement Approach applies from 1 January 2025
- Banks must ensure loss databases meet minimum data requirements
  (10 years of loss data); transitional relief may apply for
  institutions building data history

Market risk (FRTB):
- The revised standardized approach and revised internal models
  approach apply from 1 January 2025
- Banks previously authorized for IMA must obtain renewed FINMA
  authorization under the revised framework

16.2 Historical Transitional Provisions
-----------------------------------------
The original CAO of 2012 included phase-in schedules for:
- CET1 minimum ratio: 3.5% (2013) to 4.5% (2019)
- Capital conservation buffer: 0.625% (2016) to 2.5% (2019)
- Regulatory deductions: 20% (2014) to 100% (2018)
- Tier 2 grandfathering of non-compliant instruments (expired 2022)
These transitional provisions are now fully expired.

16.3 Systemically Important Banks — Post-Credit Suisse Reforms
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Following the forced merger of Credit Suisse into UBS in March 2023,
the Federal Council proposed amendments (June 2025) to strengthen
the capital framework for systemically important banks:
- Enhanced capital requirements for foreign participations at parent
  company level
- Strengthened recovery and resolution planning
- Extended FINMA supervisory powers, including senior manager
  accountability
- Public consultation expected Q4 2025 / Q1 2026
- Targeted implementation: 1 January 2027
