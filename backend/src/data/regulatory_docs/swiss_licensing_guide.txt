1.1 Overview

SRO "licence" refers to membership with a Swiss self-regulatory organisation under the Anti-Money

- Extract from the commercial register (Handelsregisterauszug) for the Swiss company
- Articles of association/statutes and shareholder register

  - Transaction monitoring systems
  - Risk classification frameworks
  - Record keeping protocols

  relevant qualifications and experience in financial services/compliance

  AML officer is mandated

1.5 Ownership and Source-of-Funds Documents

- Shareholder structure overview, including UBO declaration up to natural persons

  or significant influence (bank statements, contracts, sale documents, etc., in line with SRO guidance)
- Group structure chart if the entity is part of an international group, including description of
  intra-group services and flows

1.6 Financial and Infrastructure Evidence

- Recent financial statements or opening balance sheet and proof of paid-in share capital meeting
  the SRO's minimum capital expectations for your activity
- Proof of Swiss office (lease agreement or office service contract) and local contact address
- Proof of a Swiss bank account in the company's name or evidence of banking relationship in
  progress, depending on SRO practice

1.7 SRO-Specific Forms and Confirmations

- Completed and signed SRO application/affiliation form (Beitrittsgesuch) including declarations
  on AML responsibilities and business scope
- Signed declaration of adherence to the SRO regulations and fee schedule, including agreement
  to audits and ongoing supervision

  business model (whether SRO membership is sufficient or a FINMA licence is required)

== 5. KEY CONSIDERATIONS AND BEST PRACTICES ==

5.1 Choosing Between SRO and FINMA Licence

The decision between SRO membership and a full FINMA licence depends on several factors:

- Business model: Limited payment services or advisory activities may qualify for SRO;
  deposit-taking, lending, or complex investment services require FINMA licensing
- Capital requirements: SRO membership has lower capital thresholds than FINMA licences
- Timeline: SRO applications are significantly faster (1-3 months vs 6-18 months)
- Regulatory burden: SRO supervision is lighter-touch, focused primarily on AML/KYC compliance
- Market perception: FINMA licences generally carry greater regulatory credibility

5.2 Role of Professional Advisors

Given the complexity of Swiss financial regulation, most applicants engage:
- Swiss law firms specialising in financial regulation (particularly Zuerich-based firms)
- Compliance consultants for policy development and implementation
- Recognised audit firms for pre-application and ongoing audits
- IT security specialists for infrastructure assessments

Professional fees typically range from 50,000-200,000 CHF for the application phase, plus ongoing costs.

5.3 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Incomplete or inconsistent documentation across application forms
- Insufficient detail in business plans and risk assessments
- Inadequate source of funds/source of wealth documentation for shareholders
- Failure to demonstrate Swiss management presence and local infrastructure
- Underestimating capital requirements and operational costs
- Rushing the pre-application consultation phase with FINMA
- Not engaging a recognised auditor early in the process

5.4 Access to Official Resources

Key official resources for applicants:
- FINMA website (www.finma.ch): Authorisation pages by licence type
- EHP platform: Self-registration at FINMA portal for access to application templates
- FINMA authorised institutions register: To review existing licence holders
- SRO websites: VQF (www.vqf.ch), PolyReg (www.polyreg.ch), SO-FIT for specific membership requirements
- FINMA guidance documents and circulars: Available in Documents section


== 6. CONCLUSION ==

Swiss financial and fintech licensing offers a comprehensive regulatory framework that balances
innovation with consumer protection and financial stability. The tiered approach — from SRO
membership for lighter activities to full FINMA licences for complex financial services — allows
firms to choose appropriate regulatory pathways based on their business models.

Success in obtaining Swiss licences requires thorough preparation, complete documentation,
professional advisory support, and realistic timeline expectations. The Electronic Hub Platform (EHP)
has streamlined many aspects of the application process, but applicants should anticipate substantial
engagement with FINMA case officers and auditors throughout the review period.

For any licensing project, the recommended first step is to contact FINMA directly via the appropriate
email address (authorisation@finma.ch, fintech@finma.ch) to discuss your specific business model
and receive preliminary guidance on the most appropriate regulatory pathway.
