The VQF (Verein zur Qualitaetssicherung von Finanzdienstleistungen — Association
for Quality Assurance of Financial Services) is the largest and most established
self-regulatory organization (SRO) in Switzerland. Founded in 1998, it is

1.2 Crypto-Friendly Reputation

VQF was among the first SROs globally to develop specific rules and guidance for
crypto and blockchain businesses. Its Rules of Organization (Reglement) include
explicit provisions for virtual asset service providers, and it has admitted
numerous crypto exchanges, custody providers, token issuers, and blockchain-
related financial intermediaries. VQF actively engages with the crypto industry
and regularly updates its rules to reflect evolving regulatory expectations and
technological developments.

  obligations for VQF members

AMLO, and AMLO-FINMA.
