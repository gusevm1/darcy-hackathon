================================================================================
I. PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVE
================================================================================

FINMA Circular 2018/3 sets out the regulatory requirements applicable to
outsourcing arrangements entered into by banks, securities dealers and
insurance companies supervised by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory
Authority (FINMA). The circular defines the conditions under which
regulated institutions may outsource significant functions to third-party
service providers while maintaining adequate organizational structures
and risk controls (Rz 1).

The primary objectives of the circular are:

  - To ensure that outsourcing does not impair the supervised
    institution's ability to comply with financial market legislation
  - To protect the interests of clients, policyholders and creditors
  - To preserve FINMA's ability to exercise effective supervision
    over outsourced functions
  - To establish a principles-based framework that allows institutions
    to implement outsourcing arrangements proportionate to their
    business model and risk situation
  - To replace the previous circular (FINMA-RS 2008/7) with a modernized
    framework that accommodates technological developments, including
    cloud computing

The circular adopts a principles-based and technology-neutral approach,
enabling institutions to use modern technologies such as cloud computing
while maintaining appropriate risk management (Rz 1-2).

================================================================================
II. LEGAL BASIS
================================================================================

The circular derives its legal authority from several provisions of Swiss
financial market legislation:

  Banking sector:
  - Federal Act on Banks and Savings Banks (Banking Act, BA),
    Art. 3 para. 2 let. a -- requirement for proper organization
  - Stock Exchange Act (SESTA), Art. 10 para. 2 let. a -- organizational
    requirements for securities dealers
  - Stock Exchange Ordinance (SESTO), Art. 19 -- outsourcing of functions

  Insurance sector:
  - Insurance Supervision Act (ISA), Art. 4 para. 2 let. j -- business plan
    requirement for outsourcing of significant functions
  - ISA Art. 5 para. 2 -- conditions for authorization
  - ISA Art. 14 para. 3 -- organizational requirements
  - ISA Art. 47 para. 2 -- outsourcing in insurance

  General:
  - Financial Market Supervision Act (FINMASA), Art. 7 para. 1 let. b --
    FINMA's authority to issue circulars specifying the application
    of financial market legislation (Rz 2)

The circular constitutes binding supervisory practice and must be observed
by all institutions within its scope. FINMA may take enforcement action
in cases of non-compliance.

================================================================================
III. SCOPE AND ADDRESSEES
================================================================================

The circular applies to the following categories of supervised entities
(Rz 3-4):

  a) Banks with a registered office in Switzerland
  b) Swiss branches of foreign banks
  c) Securities dealers with a registered office in Switzerland
  d) Swiss branches of foreign securities dealers
  e) Insurance companies with a registered office in Switzerland
  f) Swiss branches of foreign insurance companies that are required
     to apply for an operating license or approval for individual
     elements of their business plan within Switzerland

Entities NOT in scope include:
  - Fund management companies
  - Asset managers of collective investment schemes
  - Financial market infrastructures (FMIs)
  - FinTech licensees (subject to separate proportionate requirements)
  - Directly Subordinated Financial Intermediaries (DSFIs)

The circular applies to all outsourcing arrangements regardless of
whether the service provider is a regulated entity, an affiliate
within the same group, or an unrelated third party (Rz 5-6).

================================================================================
IV. DEFINITION OF OUTSOURCING
================================================================================

Outsourcing within the meaning of the circular occurs when a supervised
institution mandates a service provider to carry out independently and
on an ongoing basis all or part of a function that is significant to
the institution's business activities (Rz 4).

Key elements of the definition:

  1. MANDATING: The institution transfers the performance of a function
     to another entity (the service provider)

  2. INDEPENDENTLY: The service provider performs the function with a
     degree of autonomy and self-direction

  3. ONGOING BASIS: The arrangement is of a permanent or recurring
     nature, not a one-off transaction

  4. SIGNIFICANT FUNCTION: The function has a material effect on
     compliance with the objectives and regulations of financial
     market supervisory legislation (Rz 4)

Outsourcing vs. Procurement:
-----------------------------
Not every engagement of an external service provider constitutes
outsourcing within the meaning of the circular. The following are
generally NOT considered outsourcing:

  - One-time or project-based engagements (e.g., consulting mandates)
  - Purchase of standardized products or services that do not
    involve the transfer of a significant business function
  - Procurement of utilities, office supplies or standard facility
    management services
  - Use of market data providers for publicly available information
  - Engagement of legal counsel or external auditors for specific
    mandates
  - Use of interbank payment and settlement systems operated by
    regulated financial market infrastructures

The critical distinction lies in whether a "significant function" is
being transferred to the service provider for independent and ongoing
performance. If the function is not significant to the institution's
regulatory compliance or business operations, the arrangement falls
outside the scope of the circular (Rz 4-5).

================================================================================
V. SIGNIFICANT VS NON-SIGNIFICANT OUTSOURCING
================================================================================

The circular differentiates between outsourcing of significant functions
and outsourcing of non-significant functions. The regulatory requirements
apply in full only to the outsourcing of significant functions (Rz 4-5).

Significant functions are those that have a material effect on compliance
with the aims and regulations of financial market supervisory legislation.
When assessing significance, institutions should consider:

  - Whether the function directly supports the institution's core
    business activities (e.g., lending, trading, insurance underwriting)
  - Whether disruption of the function would materially impair the
    institution's ability to operate or comply with regulatory obligations
  - The volume and criticality of client data processed by the function
  - The financial and reputational impact of a failure in the function
  - Whether the function is part of the institution's internal control
    framework

Examples of potentially significant functions:
  - Core banking system operations and IT infrastructure management
  - Payment processing and transaction settlement
  - Risk management calculations and reporting
  - Compliance monitoring and AML transaction screening
  - Client data storage and processing
  - Actuarial and claims processing functions (insurance)
  - Portfolio management and investment advisory functions
  - Internal audit functions (subject to additional restrictions)

Institutions must conduct a thorough assessment of significance before
entering into any outsourcing arrangement and document the rationale
for their classification decision (Rz 4-7).

================================================================================
VI. FUNCTIONS THAT CANNOT BE OUTSOURCED
================================================================================

Certain core functions may not be outsourced under any circumstances
(Rz 8-13):

  a) CORE BOARD FUNCTIONS: The governing body's functions of guidance,
     supreme supervision and control cannot be outsourced. The board
     of directors (or equivalent body) must retain responsibility for
     setting strategy, overseeing risk management and ensuring
     regulatory compliance.

  b) CENTRAL EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS: Key management decisions
     and functions involving strategic direction of the institution
     cannot be delegated to external service providers.

  c) CLIENT RELATIONSHIP DECISIONS: The decision to accept or terminate
     client relationships must be retained within the institution
     (Rz 10).

  d) CATEGORY 1-3 SPECIFIC RESTRICTIONS: Banks, securities dealers and
     insurance companies in supervisory categories 1 to 3 must maintain
     their own independent risk control and compliance functions as
     separate organizational units. These functions cannot be fully
     outsourced for institutions in these categories (Rz 11-13).

  e) For institutions in categories 4 and 5, the requirement for
     independent risk control and compliance functions is less strict.
     These institutions may designate a member of executive management
     to oversee risk control and compliance, but the core function must
     still be governed internally (Rz 13.1-13.3).

================================================================================
VII. RISK ASSESSMENT BEFORE OUTSOURCING
================================================================================

Before entering into an outsourcing arrangement, the institution must
conduct a comprehensive risk assessment. This assessment must cover
(Rz 14-15):

  a) OPERATIONAL RISK: Assessment of the risk that the service provider
     fails to perform the outsourced function adequately, including
     the risk of service interruptions and quality deterioration.

  b) CONCENTRATION RISK: Evaluation of whether the outsourcing creates
     an unacceptable concentration of dependencies on a single service
     provider or a small number of providers.

  c) LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE RISK: Analysis of the legal framework
     governing the outsourcing relationship, including applicable law,
     jurisdiction and enforceability of contractual provisions.

  d) COUNTRY RISK: For cross-border outsourcing, assessment of the
     political, legal and economic stability of the country where the
     service provider is located.

  e) DATA PROTECTION AND CONFIDENTIALITY RISK: Evaluation of risks
     related to the protection of client data, banking secrecy and
     insurance secrecy.

  f) REPUTATIONAL RISK: Assessment of the potential reputational
     impact if the outsourcing arrangement fails or results in
     regulatory sanctions.

  g) STRATEGIC RISK: Evaluation of the long-term implications of the
     outsourcing, including the institution's ability to maintain
     control over the outsourced function and to terminate or
     transition the arrangement if necessary.

The risk assessment must be documented, approved by the appropriate
governance body (board or executive management, depending on the
significance of the outsourcing) and reviewed periodically (Rz 14-16).

================================================================================
VIII. DUE DILIGENCE ON SERVICE PROVIDERS
================================================================================

The institution must conduct adequate due diligence on prospective
service providers before entering into an outsourcing arrangement
(Rz 16-17):

  a) PROFESSIONAL COMPETENCE: Verify that the service provider possesses
     the professional experience, technical expertise and organizational
     capacity to perform the outsourced function reliably and to the
     required standard.

  b) FINANCIAL STABILITY: Assess the service provider's financial
     soundness and ability to sustain operations over the term of the
     outsourcing arrangement.

  c) REGULATORY STATUS: Determine whether the service provider is subject
     to regulatory supervision and, if so, verify its compliance record.

  d) REPUTATION: Evaluate the service provider's market reputation,
     track record and references from other clients.

  e) SECURITY MEASURES: Verify that the service provider maintains
     adequate information security, physical security and business
     continuity measures.

  f) SUBCONTRACTING PRACTICES: Understand the service provider's
     approach to subcontracting and ensure that any subcontractors
     meet the same standards.

  g) LOCATION: Identify all locations where the outsourced function
     will be performed and where data will be stored or processed.

The level of due diligence should be proportionate to the significance
and risk profile of the outsourcing arrangement (Rz 16-17).

================================================================================
IX. SELECTION, INSTRUCTION AND MONITORING
================================================================================

Section V.B of the circular addresses the ongoing obligations of the
institution in relation to the service provider (Rz 16-21):

  SELECTION (Rz 16-17):
  - The institution must select the service provider based on its
    professional experience and demonstrated competence
  - The selection process must be documented and the rationale for
    the choice of provider must be recorded

  INSTRUCTION (Rz 17-18):
  - The institution must provide clear instructions to the service
    provider regarding the scope, quality and standards of the
    outsourced function
  - The institution must ensure that the service provider understands
    and complies with all applicable regulatory requirements

  MONITORING (Rz 19-21):
  - The institution must designate an internal unit responsible for
    monitoring and controlling the service provider
  - The service provider's performance must be monitored and assessed
    on an ongoing basis
  - The outsourced function must be integrated into the institution's
    internal control system (ICS)
  - The main risks associated with the outsourcing must be systematically
    identified, monitored, quantified and controlled
  - Regular reporting on the service provider's performance must be
    provided to the responsible governance bodies

================================================================================
X. CONTRACTUAL REQUIREMENTS (MINIMUM CLAUSES)
================================================================================

The outsourcing must be governed by a written contract or another form
that allows for evidence to be provided in writing. In addition to
identifying the parties and describing the outsourced function, the
agreement must contain at least the following minimum elements
(Rz 24-31):

  1. SCOPE OF SERVICES: Clear and detailed description of the outsourced
     function, including service levels, quality standards and
     performance metrics (Rz 24).

  2. RIGHT TO INSTRUCT AND CONTROL: The institution must retain the
     contractual right to issue instructions to and exercise control
     over the service provider in relation to the outsourced function
     (Rz 24).

  3. INFORMATION AND REPORTING: The service provider must be obligated
     to provide the institution with all relevant information about the
     performance of the outsourced function, including regular reports
     and immediate notification of material incidents (Rz 24).

  4. CONFIDENTIALITY AND DATA PROTECTION: The agreement must include
     provisions ensuring the confidentiality and protection of all data
     related to the outsourced function, including client data and
     proprietary information (Rz 21).

  5. AUDIT AND INSPECTION RIGHTS: The agreement must grant the
     institution, its regulatory auditor and FINMA the contractual
     right to inspect and audit all information relating to the
     outsourced function at any time and without restriction (Rz 26-29).

  6. SUBCONTRACTING: The agreement must require the service provider
     to obtain the institution's prior approval before involving
     subcontractors in the performance of significant functions.
     Subcontractors must be bound by the same requirements (Rz 33-34).

  7. SECURITY REQUIREMENTS: Where security-relevant functions are
     outsourced, particularly in the area of IT, the institution and
     the service provider must contractually agree on security
     requirements (Rz 21).

  8. BUSINESS CONTINUITY: The agreement must require the development
     and maintenance of a contingency plan that allows the continuation
     of the outsourced function in emergencies (Rz 21).

  9. TERMINATION AND EXIT: The agreement must include provisions
     governing the orderly termination of the outsourcing arrangement,
     including transition periods, data migration and handover
     procedures (Rz 18, 18.1).

  10. LIABILITY: Clear allocation of responsibilities and liability
      between the institution and the service provider.

  11. GOVERNING LAW AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION: Specification of the
      applicable law and dispute resolution mechanisms.

  12. REGULATORY COMPLIANCE: The agreement must include measures to
      ensure implementation of all requirements set out in the
      circular, in particular margin nos. 21, 24, 26, 29, 30 and 31
      (Rz 24-31).

================================================================================
XI. DATA PROTECTION AND CONFIDENTIALITY
================================================================================

The circular requires institutions to ensure that outsourcing
arrangements do not compromise the confidentiality or integrity of
client data or other protected information (Rz 21):

  BANKING SECRECY (Art. 47 BA):
  - Banking secrecy obligations continue to apply in full to
    outsourced functions
  - The service provider and its employees must be bound by
    equivalent confidentiality obligations
  - Transfer of client-identifying data must comply with applicable
    banking secrecy requirements

  INSURANCE SECRECY:
  - For insurance companies, equivalent confidentiality obligations
    apply under the Insurance Supervision Act

  DATA PROTECTION:
  - Outsourcing arrangements must comply with the Swiss Federal Act
    on Data Protection (FADP) and, where applicable, the revised
    FADP (revFADP) effective 1 September 2023
  - For cross-border data transfers, the institution must ensure
    adequate data protection in the receiving country

  CLIENT DATA TRANSFERS (Rz 30):
  - Mass transfers of client-identifying data must comply with
    Annex 3 of FINMA Circular 2008/21 (Operational Risks -- Banks)
  - The institution must ensure that client data can be retrieved
    and repatriated at all times

  Note: The circular itself does not provide detailed guidance on
  banking secrecy or data protection matters, as these are governed
  by separate legislation (BA Art. 47, FADP). Institutions must
  ensure compliance with all applicable data protection laws
  independently of the circular's requirements.

================================================================================
XII. CLOUD OUTSOURCING SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================

FINMA Circular 2018/3 adopts a technology-neutral approach and does
not contain specific provisions exclusively for cloud outsourcing.
Cloud-based outsourcing arrangements are subject to the same general
requirements as any other outsourcing arrangement (Rz 1-2).

However, the following considerations are particularly relevant
for cloud outsourcing:

  APPLICABILITY:
  - Use of cloud services (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) that involve the
    transfer of significant functions falls within scope of the
    circular
  - Institutions must assess whether the use of a particular cloud
    service constitutes outsourcing of a significant function

  DATA LOCATION:
  - Institutions must know at all times where their data is stored
    and processed
  - For cross-border cloud deployments, the cross-border outsourcing
    requirements apply (see Section XIII)

  MULTI-TENANCY RISKS:
  - Institutions must assess risks specific to shared cloud
    infrastructure, including data segregation, security and
    availability

  AUDIT AND INSPECTION:
  - The institution, its auditor and FINMA must be able to exercise
    audit and inspection rights even when functions are hosted in
    cloud environments
  - Cloud providers must contractually commit to facilitating such
    access

  SUB-PROCESSING:
  - Cloud providers' use of subcontractors and sub-processors must
    comply with the sub-outsourcing requirements (see Section XV)
  - Institutions must be informed of all subcontractors involved in
    the cloud service delivery chain

  SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS:
  - Cloud outsourcing contracts must include clear SLAs covering
    availability, performance, incident response and data recovery

  ENCRYPTION AND SECURITY:
  - Where security-relevant functions are outsourced to the cloud,
    agreed security requirements must be contractually stipulated
    (Rz 21)

  EXIT AND DATA PORTABILITY:
  - Institutions must ensure the ability to migrate data and
    functions away from the cloud provider in an orderly manner

  Note: FINMA has published additional guidance on cloud outsourcing
  through supervisory communications and the interaction with FINMA
  Circular 2023/1 (Operational Risks and Resilience) which provides
  more specific requirements for critical data in cloud environments.

================================================================================
XIII. CROSS-BORDER OUTSOURCING CONSIDERATIONS
================================================================================

The outsourcing of significant functions to a service provider in a
foreign jurisdiction is permitted, subject to additional requirements
(Rz 30-31):

  a) ENFORCEMENT OF RIGHTS: The institution must explicitly ensure
     that it, its regulatory auditor and FINMA can duly exercise and
     enforce their inspection and audit rights in the foreign
     jurisdiction (Rz 30).

  b) RECOVERY AND RESOLUTION: The institution must ensure that the
     outsourcing will not hinder a recovery or resolution in
     Switzerland. Access to data stored abroad must remain possible
     in Switzerland at all times for recovery and resolution purposes
     (Rz 31).

  c) LEGAL OPINION: Under the original 2008/7 circular, a formal legal
     opinion on enforceability was required. The revised circular
     2018/3 removed this formal requirement but institutions are still
     expected to satisfy themselves regarding the enforceability of
     their contractual rights (Rz 30).

  d) COUNTRY RISK ASSESSMENT: The institution must conduct an
     assessment of the legal, political and economic risks in the
     country where the service provider is located and where data
     will be stored or processed.

  e) CLIENT DATA CROSS-BORDER TRANSFERS: Where mass client-identifying
     data is transferred across borders, the institution must comply
     with Annex 3 of FINMA Circular 2008/21 (Operational Risks --
     Banks) (Rz 30).

  f) DATA PROTECTION ADEQUACY: The institution must ensure that the
     data protection regime in the receiving country provides an
     adequate level of protection, consistent with Swiss data
     protection law (FADP).

  g) REGULATORY COOPERATION: Institutions should consider whether
     effective regulatory cooperation mechanisms exist between FINMA
     and the supervisory authority in the country where the service
     provider is located.

  h) POLITICAL AND SOVEREIGN RISK: Risk of government action in the
     foreign jurisdiction that could restrict the institution's access
     to data or the service provider's ability to perform the
     outsourced function.

================================================================================
XIV. AUDIT RIGHTS AND FINMA ACCESS
================================================================================

The circular establishes comprehensive audit and inspection rights
(Rz 26-29):

  CONTRACTUAL AUDIT RIGHTS (Rz 26):
  - The institution, its regulatory auditor and FINMA must have the
    contractual right to inspect and audit all information relating
    to the outsourced function at any time and without restriction
  - This right extends to the service provider's premises, systems,
    records and personnel involved in the outsourced function

  SCOPE OF AUDIT RIGHTS:
  - Access to all data, documents and records related to the
    outsourced function
  - Right to conduct on-site inspections at the service provider's
    facilities
  - Right to interview service provider personnel
  - Access to the service provider's internal control systems and
    audit reports
  - Right to commission independent audits of the outsourced function

  FINMA DIRECT ACCESS (Rz 27-28):
  - If the service provider is not supervised by FINMA, the
    institution and the service provider must agree on a contractual
    obligation of the service provider to provide FINMA with all
    information and documentation about the outsourced functions
    necessary for FINMA's supervisory activities
  - FINMA must be able to verify compliance with supervisory
    regulations at the service provider level

  DELEGATION OF AUDITS (Rz 29):
  - The institution's regulatory audit firm may delegate auditing
    tasks to the service provider's own audit firm, provided the
    latter possesses the necessary qualifications
  - Audit reports must be provided to FINMA on request

  PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS:
  - Institutions should ensure that audit clauses are operationally
    effective, not merely contractual formalities
  - For large cloud providers, institutions may need to accept
    pooled audit mechanisms or rely on independent third-party audit
    certifications (e.g., ISAE 3402/SOC 2 reports) as a complement
    to direct audit rights
  - The inability to exercise effective audit rights constitutes a
    material impediment to outsourcing

================================================================================
XV. SUB-OUTSOURCING (CHAIN OUTSOURCING)
================================================================================

The circular addresses the involvement of subcontractors by the
primary service provider (Rz 33-35):

  NOTIFICATION AND APPROVAL (Rz 33):
  - The institution must ensure that it is informed at an early stage
    about the involvement or change of subcontractors performing
    significant functions
  - The institution must have the option of terminating the
    outsourcing in an orderly manner if a subcontractor change is
    unacceptable (Rz 18.1)

  Note: The original 2018 version required prior approval for
  subcontractors. The partial revision effective 1 January 2020
  softened this to an early-stage notification requirement, providing
  greater flexibility while maintaining institutional oversight
  (Rz 33, as amended).

  SAME REQUIREMENTS (Rz 34):
  - Where subcontractors are involved in the performance of
    significant functions, they must be bound by the same
    requirements as the primary service provider
  - This includes confidentiality, data protection, security,
    audit rights and business continuity obligations

  CHAIN RISK (Rz 35):
  - The institution must assess and manage the risks arising from
    sub-outsourcing chains
  - The institution remains responsible for the outsourced function
    regardless of the number of levels in the sub-outsourcing chain

  INTRA-GROUP CONSIDERATIONS (Rz 22-23):
  - With regard to the requirements set out in Rz 16-21 and 32-35,
    relationships within a group or conglomerate may be considered
    to the extent that the risks typically associated with outsourcing
    are demonstrably absent or certain requirements are not relevant
    or are met in some other way (Rz 22)

================================================================================
XVI. BUSINESS CONTINUITY FOR OUTSOURCED FUNCTIONS
================================================================================

The circular requires institutions to ensure business continuity for
all outsourced significant functions (Rz 21):

  CONTINGENCY PLANNING:
  - The institution and the service provider must jointly develop a
    contingency plan that allows the continuation of the outsourced
    function in emergencies
  - The contingency plan must be tested regularly and updated as
    necessary

  STANDARDS OF CARE:
  - The service provider must apply the same degree of care and
    attention to the outsourced function as the institution would
    if performing the function itself

  RECOVERY CAPABILITIES:
  - The institution must maintain the ability to resume the
    outsourced function internally or through an alternative service
    provider within acceptable timeframes
  - Recovery time objectives (RTOs) and recovery point objectives
    (RPOs) for outsourced functions must be defined and agreed upon

  INCIDENT MANAGEMENT:
  - The service provider must immediately notify the institution of
    any material incident affecting the outsourced function
  - The institution must integrate outsourced functions into its
    overall incident management and crisis response framework

  TESTING:
  - Business continuity plans for outsourced functions must be tested
    at least annually
  - The institution should participate in or observe the service
    provider's business continuity tests

  RESOLUTION PLANNING:
  - The outsourcing must not hinder the recovery or resolution of
    the institution in Switzerland (Rz 31)
  - The institution must ensure that critical data and functions
    remain accessible in a resolution scenario

================================================================================
XVII. CONCENTRATION RISK MANAGEMENT
================================================================================

Institutions must assess and manage concentration risk arising from
outsourcing arrangements:

  SINGLE PROVIDER CONCENTRATION:
  - Over-reliance on a single service provider creates a significant
    risk exposure
  - Institutions should assess the consequences of a service provider
    failure and the availability of alternative providers

  SYSTEMIC CONCENTRATION:
  - FINMA is aware of and monitors systemic concentration risks where
    multiple supervised institutions outsource critical functions to
    the same service provider
  - Institutions should consider systemic dependencies when assessing
    outsourcing risks

  MITIGATION MEASURES:
  - Diversification of service providers where feasible
  - Maintenance of internal capabilities to resume outsourced functions
  - Multi-vendor strategies for critical functions
  - Contractual provisions for orderly termination and transition
  - Regular assessment of the service provider landscape

  RISK MONITORING:
  - Concentration risk must be included in the institution's ongoing
    risk assessment and reporting framework
  - Material concentration risks must be reported to the governing body

================================================================================
XVIII. INVENTORY AND DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================

The circular requires comprehensive documentation of all outsourcing
arrangements (Rz 14-15):

  OUTSOURCING INVENTORY:
  - The institution must prepare and maintain an up-to-date inventory
    of all outsourced functions at all times
  - The inventory must contain:
      * Description of each outsourced function
      * Name and details of the service provider
      * Identification of subcontractors performing significant functions
      * Name of the service recipient (if different from the institution)
      * Name of the internal unit responsible for monitoring and
        controlling the outsourcing
      * Classification of the function as significant or non-significant
      * Location(s) where the function is performed and data is stored

  DOCUMENTATION OF RISK ASSESSMENTS:
  - All risk assessments conducted before and during outsourcing
    arrangements must be documented
  - Documentation must include the rationale for classification
    decisions and risk mitigation measures

  GOVERNANCE DOCUMENTATION:
  - Board and management decisions regarding outsourcing must be
    documented
  - Internal policies and procedures for outsourcing governance must
    be maintained

  CONTRACTUAL DOCUMENTATION:
  - All outsourcing agreements, amendments and related correspondence
    must be maintained
  - Service level reports and performance assessments must be documented

  AVAILABILITY:
  - The inventory and all related documentation must be available to
    FINMA and the regulatory auditor upon request at all times

================================================================================
XIX. FINMA NOTIFICATION AND APPROVAL REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================

The circular does not impose a general obligation to notify FINMA
or obtain prior approval before entering into outsourcing arrangements.
However, certain notification obligations apply:

  INSURANCE COMPANIES -- BUSINESS PLAN:
  - For insurance companies, outsourcing of significant functions
    forms part of the business plan under ISA Art. 4 para. 2 let. j
  - Material changes to outsourcing arrangements may require amendment
    of the business plan and FINMA approval

  BANKS -- NO PRIOR APPROVAL:
  - For banks and securities dealers, no prior FINMA approval is
    required for outsourcing arrangements
  - However, the institution must be prepared to provide FINMA with
    information about its outsourcing arrangements at any time
  - FINMA may request the outsourcing inventory and related
    documentation as part of its supervisory activities

  MATERIAL CHANGES:
  - Institutions should inform FINMA of material changes to
    outsourcing arrangements that could affect the institution's
    risk profile or FINMA's ability to exercise supervision

  SUPERVISORY REVIEW:
  - FINMA may review outsourcing arrangements as part of regular
    supervisory audits or targeted examinations
  - The regulatory auditor must assess the institution's compliance
    with the circular's requirements as part of its audit mandate

================================================================================
XX. MONITORING AND CONTROL OF OUTSOURCED ACTIVITIES
================================================================================

The institution bears full responsibility vis-a-vis FINMA for all
outsourced functions (Rz 23). This responsibility cannot be delegated
through outsourcing arrangements.

  ONGOING MONITORING (Rz 19-21):
  - An internal unit must be designated as responsible for monitoring
    and controlling the service provider
  - The service provider's performance must be monitored and assessed
    on an ongoing basis against agreed service levels

  INTEGRATION INTO ICS:
  - The outsourced function must be integrated into the institution's
    internal control system (ICS)
  - Control activities for outsourced functions must be defined and
    implemented
  - Key risk indicators (KRIs) for outsourced functions must be
    established

  RISK MANAGEMENT:
  - The main risks associated with the outsourcing must be
    systematically identified, monitored, quantified and controlled
  - Risk assessments must be updated periodically and when material
    changes occur

  REPORTING:
  - Regular reporting on the outsourcing relationship must be
    provided to the responsible governance bodies
  - Material incidents and performance issues must be escalated
    promptly

  PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT:
  - Service level agreements must be monitored continuously
  - Non-performance or underperformance must trigger remediation
    measures, up to and including termination of the arrangement

  GOVERNANCE:
  - The board or its designated committee must exercise oversight
    over the institution's outsourcing arrangements
  - Executive management must ensure that adequate resources are
    dedicated to outsourcing governance and monitoring

================================================================================
XXI. EXIT STRATEGY AND TRANSITION PLANNING
================================================================================

The circular requires institutions to maintain the ability to
terminate outsourcing arrangements and transition functions in an
orderly manner (Rz 18, 18.1):

  EXIT CAPABILITY:
  - The institution must ensure the ability to backsource the
    outsourced function internally or transfer it to an alternative
    service provider if the risk assessment necessitates an exit
  - The exit strategy must be developed before or at the time of
    entering into the outsourcing arrangement

  CONTRACTUAL EXIT PROVISIONS:
  - The outsourcing agreement must include provisions for orderly
    termination, including:
      * Adequate notice periods
      * Transition assistance obligations of the service provider
      * Data migration and handover procedures
      * Continued service provision during the transition period
      * Return or deletion of institution and client data

  TRANSITION PLANNING:
  - The institution must have a documented transition plan that can
    be activated if the outsourcing arrangement is terminated
  - The plan must include timelines, resource requirements and
    risk mitigation measures for the transition period

  TRIGGERS FOR EXIT:
  - Material deterioration in the service provider's performance
    or financial condition
  - Unacceptable changes in the service provider's subcontracting
    arrangements
  - Regulatory concerns or enforcement actions
  - Material breach of the outsourcing agreement
  - Changes in the institution's business strategy

  TESTING:
  - Exit plans should be tested periodically to ensure their
    feasibility and effectiveness

================================================================================
XXII. SPECIFIC RULES FOR IT OUTSOURCING
================================================================================

While the circular is technology-neutral, IT outsourcing is subject
to particular attention given its significance for most supervised
institutions (Rz 21):

  SECURITY REQUIREMENTS:
  - Where security-relevant functions are outsourced, particularly
    in the area of IT, the institution and the service provider must
    contractually agree on specific security requirements
  - These requirements must cover information security, data integrity,
    access controls, encryption and incident response

  INTERACTION WITH FINMA CIRCULAR 2023/1:
  - FINMA Circular 2023/1 (Operational Risks and Resilience -- Banks)
    provides additional requirements for the management of ICT risks,
    including outsourced IT functions
  - Institutions must ensure compliance with both circulars when
    outsourcing IT functions

  IT-SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS:
  - Data center location and security standards
  - Network connectivity and redundancy
  - Disaster recovery and backup arrangements
  - Software licensing and intellectual property rights
  - Change management and release procedures
  - Vulnerability management and penetration testing
  - Incident detection and response capabilities
  - Capacity planning and scalability

  CRITICAL IT FUNCTIONS:
  - Core banking/insurance systems
  - Payment processing systems
  - Trading platforms and market access systems
  - Client-facing digital channels
  - Data warehousing and analytics platforms
  - Cybersecurity monitoring and response

  ONGOING TECHNOLOGY RISK ASSESSMENT:
  - Institutions must continuously assess the technological risks
    associated with outsourced IT functions, including the risk of
    technological obsolescence and the service provider's commitment
    to maintaining up-to-date technology

================================================================================
XXIII. OUTSOURCING WITHIN A GROUP OR CONGLOMERATE
================================================================================

The circular addresses intra-group outsourcing arrangements with
specific proportionality provisions (Rz 22-23):

  REDUCED REQUIREMENTS (Rz 22):
  - With regard to the requirements set out in Rz 16-21 (selection,
    instruction, monitoring) and Rz 32-35 (subcontracting), relationships
    within the group or conglomerate may be considered to the extent
    that the risks typically associated with outsourcing are demonstrably
    absent or certain requirements are not relevant or are met in some
    other way

  CONDITIONS FOR REDUCED REQUIREMENTS:
  - The institution must demonstrate that intra-group arrangements
    benefit from group-wide governance, risk management and compliance
    frameworks
  - The risks typically associated with third-party outsourcing (e.g.,
    misalignment of interests, information asymmetry) must be
    demonstrably mitigated by the group relationship
  - The institution must document its assessment and rationale for
    applying reduced requirements

  RETAINED OBLIGATIONS:
  - Even within a group, the supervised institution remains fully
    responsible vis-a-vis FINMA for the outsourced function (Rz 23)
  - Audit and inspection rights for FINMA and the regulatory auditor
    must be maintained
  - Business continuity and exit planning requirements continue to
    apply

  LIMITATIONS:
  - Intra-group outsourcing does not provide a blanket exemption
    from the circular's requirements
  - The institution must still conduct a risk assessment and maintain
    appropriate controls

================================================================================
XXIV. CATEGORY-SPECIFIC PROPORTIONALITY
================================================================================

The circular applies a proportionate approach based on the institution's
supervisory category (categories 1-5 as defined by FINMA):

  CATEGORY 1-3 INSTITUTIONS (systemically important and large):
  - Full application of all requirements
  - Independent risk control and compliance functions must be maintained
    as separate organizational units and cannot be fully outsourced
    (Rz 11-13)
  - More stringent expectations for risk assessment, monitoring and
    governance of outsourcing arrangements
  - Higher expectations for business continuity and exit planning

  CATEGORY 4-5 INSTITUTIONS (medium and small):
  - Proportionate application of requirements based on the institution's
    size, complexity and risk profile
  - Risk control and compliance may be overseen by a designated member
    of executive management rather than an independent function
    (Rz 13.1-13.3)
  - Greater flexibility in the application of organizational
    requirements

  SMALL BANKS REGIME (partial revision effective 1 January 2020):
  - The partial revision introduced additional proportionality
    measures for small banks as part of the "small banks regime"
  - Small banks that qualify for the regime benefit from simplified
    requirements in certain areas
  - The adjustments are reflected in the amended margin numbers
    of the circular

  INSURANCE COMPANIES:
  - Insurance companies benefit from removal of the previous limitation
    of two outsourced functions
  - The circular applies the same principles-based approach as for
    banks, with proportionate application based on the insurer's
    supervisory category and risk profile

================================================================================
XXV. TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS
================================================================================

The circular includes the following transitional provisions:

  BANKS AND SECURITIES DEALERS:
  - The provisions apply immediately to outsourcing arrangements
    concluded or materially amended after 1 April 2018
  - A five-year transition period (until 1 April 2023) was granted
    for outsourcing arrangements already in place before 1 April 2018
  - During the transition period, institutions were required to
    review and amend existing agreements to comply with the new
    requirements

  INSURANCE COMPANIES:
  - For insurance companies, the provisions apply immediately to
    new licensing applications from 1 April 2018
  - For existing insurance companies, changes are required only upon
    regulatory modification of the business plan
  - De facto, insurance companies were expected to align with the
    circular's requirements within a reasonable timeframe

  PARTIAL REVISION (1 January 2020):
  - Amendments related to the small banks regime and subcontractor
    notification took effect on 1 January 2020
  - These amendments were applicable immediately upon entry into force

================================================================================
XXVI. INTERACTION WITH OTHER FINMA CIRCULARS
================================================================================

FINMA Circular 2018/3 must be read in conjunction with other relevant
FINMA circulars and regulatory requirements:

  FINMA CIRCULAR 2008/21 (Operational Risks -- Banks):
  - Annex 3 contains specific requirements for mass transfers of
    client-identifying data, which apply to cross-border outsourcing
    (Rz 30)
  - General operational risk management requirements complement the
    outsourcing circular

  FINMA CIRCULAR 2023/1 (Operational Risks and Resilience -- Banks):
  - Provides updated requirements for operational risk management,
    ICT risk, cyber risk and operational resilience
  - Contains additional requirements for critical data management
    and cloud computing
  - Must be considered together with Circular 2018/3 for IT outsourcing

  FINMA CIRCULAR 2017/1 (Corporate Governance -- Banks):
  - Establishes governance requirements that apply to the oversight
    of outsourcing arrangements
