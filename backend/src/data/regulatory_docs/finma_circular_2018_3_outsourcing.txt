FINMA CIRCULAR 2018/3: OUTSOURCING -- BANKS AND INSURERS
================================================================================
Document Reference: FINMA-RS 2018/3
Original Title (DE): Rundschreiben 2018/3 Outsourcing -- Banken und Versicherer
Date of Issue: 5 December 2017 | Entry into Force: 1 April 2018
Last Amended: 1 January 2020 (partial revision, small banks regime)
Supersedes: FINMA Circular 2008/7 "Outsourcing Banks" (20 November 2008)
================================================================================

I. PURPOSE, SCOPE AND LEGAL BASIS
================================================================================

FINMA Circular 2018/3 sets out regulatory requirements for outsourcing
arrangements by banks, securities dealers and insurance companies. It defines
conditions under which regulated institutions may outsource significant
functions while maintaining adequate organization and risk controls (Rz 1).

Objectives: ensure outsourcing does not impair regulatory compliance; protect
clients, policyholders and creditors; preserve FINMA's supervisory capacity;
establish a principles-based, technology-neutral framework accommodating modern
technologies including cloud computing (Rz 1-2).

Legal basis -- Banking: BA Art. 3(2)(a), SESTA Art. 10(2)(a), SESTO Art. 19.
Insurance: ISA Art. 4(2)(j), Art. 5(2), Art. 14(3), Art. 47(2).
General: FINMASA Art. 7(1)(b) -- FINMA authority to issue circulars (Rz 2).

Addressees (Rz 3-4): Banks and securities dealers with Swiss registered
office; Swiss branches of foreign banks/dealers; insurance companies with Swiss
registered office; Swiss branches of foreign insurers requiring a license.
NOT in scope: fund management companies, asset managers of CIS, FMIs, FinTech
licensees, DSFIs. Applies regardless of whether the service provider is
regulated, an affiliate or an unrelated third party (Rz 5-6).

II. DEFINITION OF OUTSOURCING VS PROCUREMENT
================================================================================

Outsourcing occurs when an institution mandates a service provider to carry out
independently and on an ongoing basis all or part of a function significant to
the institution's business activities (Rz 4). Four cumulative elements:
  1. Mandating -- transferring performance to another entity
  2. Independently -- provider acts with autonomy
  3. Ongoing basis -- permanent or recurring, not one-off
  4. Significant function -- material effect on regulatory compliance

NOT outsourcing (procurement): one-time/project engagements (e.g. consulting);
purchase of standardized products not involving significant function transfer;
procurement of utilities or office supplies; market data for public info;
engagement of legal counsel or auditors for specific mandates; use of interbank
payment/settlement systems run by regulated FMIs (Rz 4-5).

III. SIGNIFICANT VS NON-SIGNIFICANT OUTSOURCING
================================================================================

Full requirements apply only to significant functions -- those with a material
effect on compliance with financial market legislation (Rz 4-5). Assessment
criteria: whether the function supports core business; whether disruption would
materially impair operations or compliance; volume/criticality of client data;
financial and reputational impact of failure; role in internal controls.

Examples of significant functions: core banking/insurance systems; payment
processing; risk management; compliance/AML screening; client data storage;
actuarial/claims processing; portfolio management; internal audit.

Institutions must assess significance before outsourcing and document the
classification rationale (Rz 4-7).

IV. FUNCTIONS THAT CANNOT BE OUTSOURCED
================================================================================

Certain core functions may never be outsourced (Rz 8-13):
  a) Core board functions: guidance, supreme supervision and control (Rz 8-9)
  b) Central executive management functions involving strategic decisions
  c) Decision to accept or terminate client relationships (Rz 10)
  d) Cat. 1-3 institutions: independent risk control and compliance must be
     maintained as separate organizational units (Rz 11-13)
  e) Cat. 4-5 institutions: may designate an executive management member to
     oversee risk control/compliance instead (Rz 13.1-13.3)

V. RISK ASSESSMENT BEFORE OUTSOURCING
================================================================================

Before outsourcing, a comprehensive risk assessment is required (Rz 14-15):
  - Operational risk: provider failure, service interruption, quality decline
  - Concentration risk: excessive dependence on single/few providers
  - Legal/compliance risk: applicable law, jurisdiction, enforceability
  - Country risk: political, legal, economic stability (cross-border)
  - Data protection/confidentiality risk: client data, banking/insurance secrecy
  - Reputational risk: impact of outsourcing failure
  - Strategic risk: long-term control, ability to terminate/transition

The assessment must be documented, approved by the appropriate governance body,
and reviewed periodically (Rz 14-16).

VI. DUE DILIGENCE ON SERVICE PROVIDERS
================================================================================

Adequate due diligence on prospective providers is mandatory (Rz 16-17):
  - Professional competence and technical expertise
  - Financial stability and sustainability
  - Regulatory status and compliance record
  - Market reputation and track record
  - Information security, physical security and BCM measures
  - Subcontracting practices and standards
  - All locations where functions are performed and data stored

Due diligence depth must be proportionate to significance and risk (Rz 16-17).

VII. CONTRACTUAL REQUIREMENTS (MINIMUM CLAUSES)
================================================================================

Outsourcing must be based on a written contract (or equivalent evidential form).
Beyond identifying parties and function, minimum content includes (Rz 24-31):

  1. Scope: service levels, quality standards, performance metrics (Rz 24)
  2. Right to instruct and control the service provider (Rz 24)
  3. Information/reporting obligations including incident notification (Rz 24)
  4. Confidentiality and data protection provisions (Rz 21)
  5. Audit/inspection rights for institution, auditor and FINMA -- at any time,
     without restriction (Rz 26-29)
  6. Subcontracting: early notification of subcontractor involvement; right to
     terminate if unacceptable; same requirements bind subcontractors (Rz 33-34)
  7. Security requirements, especially for IT outsourcing (Rz 21)
  8. Business continuity: contingency plan for emergencies (Rz 21)
  9. Termination/exit: orderly wind-down, transition, data handover (Rz 18, 18.1)
  10. Liability allocation between institution and provider
  11. Governing law and dispute resolution
  12. Regulatory compliance measures per Rz 21, 24, 26, 29, 30, 31

VIII. DATA PROTECTION AND CONFIDENTIALITY
================================================================================

Outsourcing must not compromise data confidentiality or integrity (Rz 21):

Banking secrecy (BA Art. 47): applies in full; provider/employees bound by
equivalent obligations; client-identifying data transfers must comply.
Insurance secrecy: equivalent obligations under ISA.
Data protection: must comply with FADP (and revised FADP from 1 Sep 2023);
cross-border transfers require adequate protection in receiving country.
Client data transfers: mass transfers of client-identifying data must comply
with Annex 3 of FINMA Circular 2008/21 (Rz 30); data must be retrievable and
repatriable at all times.

Note: The circular does not provide detailed banking secrecy or data protection
guidance, deferring to BA Art. 47 and FADP as separate regimes.

IX. CLOUD OUTSOURCING SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================

The circular is technology-neutral -- no cloud-specific provisions exist. Cloud
arrangements are subject to the same general requirements (Rz 1-2). Key
considerations for cloud outsourcing:

  - Assess whether cloud service use constitutes significant function outsourcing
  - Data location: know where data is stored/processed at all times; cross-border
    requirements apply for foreign-hosted cloud
  - Multi-tenancy: assess data segregation, security, availability risks
  - Audit/inspection: must be exercisable in cloud environments; providers must
    contractually facilitate access; pooled audits or ISAE 3402/SOC 2 reports
    may complement direct audit rights
  - Sub-processing: cloud providers' subcontractors must comply with Rz 33-35
  - SLAs: availability, performance, incident response, data recovery
  - Security: contractually stipulated requirements (Rz 21)
  - Exit/portability: ability to migrate data and functions in orderly manner

Additional guidance: FINMA Circular 2023/1 (Operational Risks and Resilience)
provides more specific requirements for critical data in cloud environments.

X. CROSS-BORDER OUTSOURCING CONSIDERATIONS
================================================================================

Outsourcing to foreign jurisdictions is permitted subject to (Rz 30-31):

  a) Enforcement of rights: institution, auditor and FINMA must be able to
     exercise and enforce inspection/audit rights abroad (Rz 30)
  b) Recovery/resolution: outsourcing must not hinder Swiss recovery/resolution;
     data stored abroad must remain accessible in Switzerland at all times (Rz 31)
  c) Legal opinion: formal requirement removed from 2008/7; institutions must
     still satisfy themselves regarding enforceability (Rz 30)
  d) Country risk assessment: legal, political, economic risks
  e) Client data: mass client-identifying data transfers comply with Annex 3
     of FINMA Circular 2008/21 (Rz 30)
  f) Data protection adequacy in receiving country per FADP
  g) Regulatory cooperation: consider mechanisms between FINMA and foreign
     supervisory authority
  h) Sovereign risk: government action restricting data access or performance

XI. AUDIT RIGHTS AND FINMA ACCESS
================================================================================

Comprehensive audit and inspection framework (Rz 26-29):

Contractual rights (Rz 26): institution, regulatory auditor and FINMA have
unrestricted right to inspect and audit all information relating to the
outsourced function at any time -- premises, systems, records, personnel.

FINMA direct access (Rz 27-28): if the provider is not FINMA-supervised, the
provider must contractually commit to providing FINMA all information and
documentation necessary for supervision.

Delegation (Rz 29): the institution's audit firm may delegate to the provider's
audit firm if qualified; audit reports available to FINMA on request.

Practical: audit clauses must be operationally effective; for large providers,
pooled audits or third-party certifications may complement direct rights;
inability to exercise effective audit rights is a material impediment.

XII. SUB-OUTSOURCING (CHAIN OUTSOURCING)
================================================================================

Subcontractor involvement by the primary provider (Rz 33-35):

Notification (Rz 33): institution must be informed at an early stage about
involvement or change of subcontractors for significant functions. The 2020
revision softened this from prior approval to early-stage notification.
Institution retains right to terminate orderly if unacceptable (Rz 18.1).

Same requirements (Rz 34): subcontractors performing significant functions
must be bound by same obligations -- confidentiality, data protection, security,
audit rights, business continuity.

Chain risk (Rz 35): institution must assess and manage sub-outsourcing chain
risks and remains responsible regardless of chain depth.

Intra-group (Rz 22): requirements in Rz 16-21 and 32-35 may be adjusted where
group relationships demonstrably mitigate typical outsourcing risks.

XIII. BUSINESS CONTINUITY FOR OUTSOURCED FUNCTIONS
================================================================================

Business continuity requirements for outsourced significant functions (Rz 21):

  - Joint contingency plan: institution and provider develop plan for emergency
    continuation; tested regularly and kept current
  - Standard of care: provider applies same diligence as institution would
  - Recovery capability: ability to resume internally or via alternative provider;
    define RTOs and RPOs
  - Incident management: immediate notification of material incidents; integration
    into institution's overall crisis response framework
  - Testing: BCPs tested at least annually; institution participates/observes
  - Resolution: outsourcing must not hinder Swiss recovery/resolution (Rz 31);
    critical data and functions remain accessible in resolution scenarios

XIV. CONCENTRATION RISK MANAGEMENT
================================================================================

Institutions must assess and manage concentration risk from outsourcing:

  - Single provider: assess consequences of provider failure and alternative
    availability
  - Systemic: FINMA monitors where multiple institutions outsource critical
    functions to the same provider; institutions consider systemic dependencies
  - Mitigation: diversify providers where feasible; maintain internal
    capabilities; multi-vendor strategies; contractual termination/transition
    provisions; regular provider landscape assessment
  - Reporting: concentration risk in ongoing risk framework; material
    concentrations reported to governing body

XV. INVENTORY AND DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================

Comprehensive documentation is required (Rz 14-15):

Outsourcing inventory (maintained up to date at all times):
  - Description of each outsourced function
  - Service provider name and details (including subcontractors)
  - Service recipient identification
  - Internal unit responsible for monitoring/controlling
  - Significance classification
  - Locations of function performance and data storage

Additional documentation: risk assessments with rationale and mitigation;
governance decisions; outsourcing policies and procedures; all agreements,
amendments and correspondence; service level reports and performance reviews.
All documentation available to FINMA and regulatory auditor upon request.

XVI. FINMA NOTIFICATION/APPROVAL REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================

No general prior notification or approval obligation exists. However:

Insurance companies: outsourcing of significant functions is part of the
business plan (ISA Art. 4(2)(j)); material changes may require business plan
amendment and FINMA approval.

Banks/securities dealers: no prior FINMA approval required; institution must
provide information on request; FINMA may request inventory and documentation.

Material changes: institutions should inform FINMA of changes affecting risk
profile or supervisory capacity.

Supervisory review: FINMA may review arrangements in regular or targeted audits;
regulatory auditor assesses circular compliance within its mandate.

XVII. MONITORING AND CONTROL OF OUTSOURCED ACTIVITIES
================================================================================

The institution bears full responsibility vis-a-vis FINMA for all outsourced
functions -- responsibility cannot be delegated (Rz 23).

  - Designated internal unit for monitoring/controlling the provider (Rz 19)
  - Ongoing performance assessment against agreed service levels (Rz 20)
  - Integration into internal control system (ICS) with defined controls and
    key risk indicators (Rz 19-21)
  - Systematic identification, monitoring, quantification and control of
    outsourcing risks; periodic and event-driven updates
  - Regular reporting to governance bodies; prompt escalation of incidents
  - Continuous SLA monitoring; remediation for underperformance up to
    termination
  - Board/committee oversight; adequate resources for governance (Rz 19-21)

XVIII. EXIT STRATEGY AND TRANSITION PLANNING
================================================================================

Institutions must maintain ability to exit outsourcing orderly (Rz 18, 18.1):

Exit capability: backsource internally or transfer to alternative provider;
strategy developed before or at entry into the arrangement.

Contractual provisions: adequate notice periods; transition assistance; data
migration and handover; continued service during transition; data return/deletion.

Transition plan: documented and activatable; includes timelines, resources, risk
mitigation. Exit triggers: material performance/financial deterioration;
unacceptable subcontractor changes; regulatory concerns; material breach;
strategic changes. Plans should be tested periodically.

XIX. SPECIFIC RULES FOR IT OUTSOURCING
================================================================================

The circular is technology-neutral but IT outsourcing receives particular
attention (Rz 21):

Security: institution and provider must contractually agree specific security
requirements -- information security, data integrity, access controls,
encryption, incident response.

IT-specific considerations: data center location and security; network
redundancy; disaster recovery and backups; software licensing/IP; change
management; vulnerability management and penetration testing; incident
detection; capacity planning and scalability.

Critical IT functions: core banking/insurance systems; payment processing;
trading platforms; client-facing channels; data warehousing; cybersecurity.

Must comply with both Circular 2018/3 and Circular 2023/1 (Operational Risks
and Resilience) which provides additional ICT/cyber risk requirements.

XX. CATEGORY-SPECIFIC PROPORTIONALITY
================================================================================

Requirements are applied proportionately based on supervisory category:

Cat. 1-3 (systemically important/large): full application; independent risk
control and compliance as separate units (Rz 11-13); stringent risk assessment,
monitoring, governance, BCM and exit planning expectations.

Cat. 4-5 (medium/small): proportionate application by size, complexity, risk;
risk control/compliance via designated executive member (Rz 13.1-13.3); greater
organizational flexibility.

Small banks regime (from 1 Jan 2020): additional proportionality measures;
qualifying small banks benefit from simplified requirements.

Insurance companies: removed prior two-function limitation; same principles-
based approach with proportionate application by category and risk profile.

XXI. INTRA-GROUP OUTSOURCING
================================================================================

Specific provisions for group/conglomerate outsourcing (Rz 22-23):

Reduced requirements (Rz 22): for Rz 16-21 (selection, instruction, monitoring)
and Rz 32-35 (subcontracting), group ties may be considered where outsourcing
risks are demonstrably absent or met otherwise.

Conditions: demonstrate group-wide governance/risk/compliance frameworks
mitigate typical third-party risks; document assessment and rationale.

Retained: institution remains fully responsible to FINMA (Rz 23); audit/
inspection rights, BCM and exit planning requirements continue.

No blanket exemption -- risk assessment and appropriate controls still required.

XXII. TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS
================================================================================

Banks/dealers: immediate application to arrangements concluded/amended after
1 Apr 2018; five-year transition (until 1 Apr 2023) for pre-existing
arrangements.

Insurance: immediate for new licenses from 1 Apr 2018; existing insurers on
business plan modification; expected alignment within reasonable timeframe.

2020 revision: small banks regime and subcontractor notification amendments
effective immediately from 1 Jan 2020.
