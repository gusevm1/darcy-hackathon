FINMA FULL BANKING LICENSE FOR CRYPTO BUSINESSES
==================================================

1. OVERVIEW AND LEGAL BASIS
----------------------------

The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) issues banking licenses
under the Federal Act on Banks and Savings Banks (Banking Act, BankA; SR 952.0)
and its implementing ordinance, the Banking Ordinance (BankO; SR 952.02). A full
banking license is the most comprehensive authorization available in Switzerland's
financial regulatory framework and permits the holder to accept deposits from the
public on a commercial basis, grant loans, and conduct all banking activities
without restriction.

For crypto and digital-asset businesses, the full banking license becomes
relevant when the business model involves accepting customer deposits denominated
in fiat currency or crypto assets that qualify as deposits under Swiss law, or
when operating a centralized exchange with an order book and matching engine that
does not qualify for the more limited DLT Trading Facility license.

The legal basis for the licensing requirement is Article 1a BankA, which states
that any person or entity that commercially accepts deposits from the public or
publicly solicits deposits requires a banking license from FINMA. FINMA's Circular
2008/3 ("Public deposits at non-banks") further clarifies when crypto-related
activities trigger this requirement.


2. WHEN IS A BANKING LICENSE REQUIRED?
---------------------------------------

A full banking license is required in the following scenarios relevant to crypto
businesses:

(a) Commercial deposit-taking: If a crypto platform accepts fiat currency
    deposits from clients that exceed the scope of the FinTech license (i.e.,
    deposits exceeding CHF 100 million or deposits that are invested or bear
    interest), a full banking license is mandatory.

(b) Operating a centralized exchange with order book: Running a matching engine
    that pairs buy and sell orders for crypto assets and holds customer funds in
    an omnibus account structure generally requires a banking license, unless the
    platform qualifies as a DLT Trading Facility under FMIA.

(c) Lending and credit activities: If a crypto business extends loans or credit
    facilities using customer deposits, it must hold a banking license.

(d) Stablecoin issuance: Issuing stablecoins backed by fiat currency reserves
    where the issuer accepts funds from the public may constitute deposit-taking
    and require a banking license, depending on the structure.

(e) Yield-generating products: Offering interest or yield on deposited crypto
    assets or fiat may trigger the deposit-taking requirement if the yield is
    generated through lending or investment of those deposits.

Activities that do NOT require a banking license include pure brokerage (matching
buyers and sellers without holding funds), custody-only services (which may fall
under the FinTech license or SRO membership), and advisory services.


3. CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS
------------------------

The minimum capital requirement for a banking license in Switzerland is
CHF 10 million in fully paid-up share capital. This is a statutory minimum under
Article 3 paragraph 2 letter b BankA. In practice, FINMA may require
significantly higher capitalization depending on the business model, risk
profile, and projected balance sheet size.

Key capital-related requirements include:

- Minimum share capital: CHF 10,000,000 fully paid-up at the time of licensing.
- Capital adequacy: Compliance with the Capital Adequacy Ordinance (CAO;
  SR 952.03), which implements Basel III standards in Switzerland.
- Risk-weighted assets: Crypto assets held on the bank's balance sheet must be
  risk-weighted according to FINMA Circular 2017/7 ("Credit risk - banks") and
  the Basel Committee's prudential treatment of crypto-asset exposures.
- Capital buffers: Banks must maintain a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of
  risk-weighted assets, and FINMA may impose institution-specific additional
  buffers.
- Liquidity requirements: Compliance with the Liquidity Ordinance (LiqO;
  SR 952.06), including Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding
  Ratio (NSFR) requirements.
- Leverage ratio: A minimum leverage ratio of 3% applies.

For crypto-specific operations, FINMA pays particular attention to the volatility
of crypto-asset holdings and may require additional capital buffers for market
risk arising from proprietary positions in digital assets.


4. ORGANIZATIONAL REQUIREMENTS
-------------------------------

FINMA imposes strict organizational requirements on banking license applicants.
These are designed to ensure sound governance, adequate risk management, and
operational resilience.

4.1 Corporate Structure
The applicant must be organized as a Swiss legal entity, typically a corporation
(Aktiengesellschaft / AG) or a cooperative (Genossenschaft). Foreign entities
must establish a Swiss subsidiary. Branch structures are possible for foreign
banks already supervised in their home jurisdiction.

4.2 Board of Directors
- Minimum of three members, the majority of whom must be independent.
- At least one board member must be resident in Switzerland.
- Board members must demonstrate individual and collective fitness and propriety
  (fit and proper test).
- The board must include members with expertise in banking, risk management,
  compliance, and -- for crypto businesses -- technology and cybersecurity.
- The chair of the board may not simultaneously serve as CEO.

4.3 Executive Management
- At least two qualified persons must be responsible for day-to-day management.
- Executive managers must be resident in Switzerland or in close proximity.
- Managers must pass FINMA's fit and proper assessment.
- Clear segregation of duties between the CEO, CFO, CRO (Chief Risk Officer),
  and CCO (Chief Compliance Officer).

4.4 Internal Control System
- Three lines of defense model: (1) business operations, (2) risk management and
  compliance, (3) internal audit.
- Internal audit must be independent and report directly to the board or the
  audit committee.
- A compliance function must be established that is independent of revenue-
  generating business units.

4.5 External Audit
- Appointment of a FINMA-recognized audit firm as regulatory auditor.
- Annual regulatory audit in addition to financial audit.
- The external auditor reports to both FINMA and the board.


5. APPLICATION PROCESS THROUGH FINMA EHP
-----------------------------------------

FINMA processes all banking license applications through its electronic platform,
the EHP (Erhebungs- und Gesuchsportal / Survey and Application Portal). The
application process proceeds as follows:

Step 1: Pre-Application Phase (optional but recommended)
- Informal consultation with FINMA's Banking Division to discuss the business
  model and confirm that a banking license is the correct authorization category.
- FINMA may provide preliminary guidance on specific requirements.
- Duration: 2-4 weeks.

Step 2: Formal Application Submission
- File the application through the EHP portal with all required documentation.
- Pay the application fee (FINMA charges on a cost-recovery basis; fees for
  banking license applications typically range from CHF 50,000 to CHF 200,000
  depending on complexity).

Step 3: Completeness Check
- FINMA reviews the application for completeness within 4-6 weeks.
- If incomplete, FINMA issues a request for supplementary information.

Step 4: Substantive Review
- Detailed review of the business plan, governance structure, capital adequacy,
  risk management framework, IT infrastructure, and AML/KYC procedures.
- FINMA may engage external experts for technical assessments, particularly for
  crypto-related technology.
- Duration: 6-12 months.

Step 5: On-site Assessment
- FINMA or its mandated auditors may conduct on-site visits to assess operational
  readiness, IT systems, and organizational structure.

Step 6: Decision
- FINMA issues the banking license with or without conditions, or rejects the
  application with reasons.
- The decision is communicated in writing and may be appealed to the Federal
  Administrative Court.


6. REQUIRED DOCUMENTATION
--------------------------

The following documents must be submitted with the banking license application:

(a) Business plan covering at least three years, including detailed financial
    projections, target market analysis, product descriptions, and growth
    strategy.

(b) Articles of association (Statuten) and organizational regulations
    (Organisationsreglement).

(c) Detailed organizational chart showing reporting lines, committees, and
    key functions.

(d) CVs, references, and supporting documentation for all members of the board
    of directors and executive management (fit and proper documentation).

(e) Shareholder structure with identification of all qualified participants
    (holders of 10% or more of capital or voting rights), including ultimate
    beneficial owners.

(f) Capital plan demonstrating compliance with minimum capital requirements and
    projected capital adequacy ratios.

(g) Comprehensive risk management framework document covering credit risk,
    market risk, operational risk, liquidity risk, and -- for crypto businesses --
    technology risk, custody risk, and smart contract risk.

(h) AML/KYC compliance manual detailing client onboarding procedures, ongoing
    monitoring, suspicious activity reporting, and sanctions screening.

(i) IT security concept (Informatik-Sicherheitskonzept) covering system
    architecture, data protection, cybersecurity measures, business continuity
    planning, and disaster recovery.

(j) Internal control system documentation including internal audit charter,
    compliance function description, and risk appetite statement.

(k) Outsourcing agreements (if any) with detailed risk assessments for each
    outsourced function.

(l) Confirmation of appointment of a FINMA-recognized regulatory auditor.

(m) Proof of minimum capital deposit (bank confirmation of CHF 10M or more).


7. TIMELINE
-------------

The typical timeline for obtaining a full banking license is 12 to 24 months from
formal application submission. The timeline breaks down approximately as follows:

- Pre-application consultation: 1-2 months
- Application preparation: 2-4 months
- Completeness check by FINMA: 1-2 months
- Substantive review: 6-12 months
- On-site assessment and follow-up: 1-3 months
- Final decision: 1-2 months

Factors that may extend the timeline include the complexity of the business model,
deficiencies in submitted documentation, FINMA's current workload, novel legal
questions arising from crypto-specific activities, and the need for international
coordination with foreign supervisors.

FINMA does not guarantee processing times and reserves the right to extend the
review period as necessary. Applicants are advised to begin the process well in
advance of their planned launch date.


8. GOVERNANCE REQUIREMENTS
---------------------------

Beyond the organizational structure described in Section 4, FINMA requires banks
to implement robust corporate governance practices:

8.1 Board Committees
- Audit Committee: Mandatory for all banks. Oversees financial reporting,
  internal and external audit, and internal controls.
- Risk Committee: Mandatory for systemically important banks; recommended for
  all others. Oversees the risk management framework.
- Compensation Committee: Required if the bank employs more than 250 staff or
  has total assets exceeding CHF 15 billion.
- Technology Committee: Recommended for crypto banks given the critical role of
  IT infrastructure.

8.2 Conflicts of Interest
- Written policies for identifying, managing, and disclosing conflicts of
  interest.
- Board members and executives must disclose all outside activities and
  financial interests.
- Transactions with related parties must be conducted at arm's length and
  documented.

8.3 Compensation
- Compensation policies must align with FINMA Circular 2010/1 ("Remuneration
  schemes").
- Variable compensation must be linked to risk-adjusted performance.
- Deferral and clawback mechanisms for senior management and material risk-takers.

8.4 Fit and Proper Requirements
- Ongoing obligation: Board members and executives must continue to meet fit
  and proper standards throughout their tenure.
- FINMA must be notified of any changes in the board or executive management
  before they take effect.
- FINMA may require removal of individuals who no longer meet the standards.


9. RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK
------------------------------

FINMA Circular 2017/1 ("Corporate governance - banks") and Circular 2008/21
("Operational risks and resilience - banks") set out detailed risk management
requirements. For crypto businesses, the following areas require particular
attention:

9.1 Market Risk
- Policies for managing exposure to crypto-asset price volatility.
- Mark-to-market or mark-to-model valuation of digital asset holdings.
- Stress testing and scenario analysis for extreme market movements.

9.2 Credit Risk
- Counterparty risk assessment for crypto lending and DeFi exposures.
- Collateral management policies for crypto-collateralized loans.
- Concentration limits for individual counterparties and asset classes.

9.3 Operational Risk
- Comprehensive operational risk framework covering technology failures, human
  error, fraud, and external events.
- Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) specific to crypto operations (e.g., failed
  transactions, smart contract vulnerabilities, private key compromises).

9.4 Liquidity Risk
- Liquidity management framework addressing the specific liquidity
  characteristics of crypto assets.
- Contingency funding plans for scenarios involving rapid client withdrawals
  or market dislocations.

9.5 Technology and Cyber Risk
- See Section 10 for detailed IT security requirements.


10. IT SECURITY REQUIREMENTS
------------------------------

Given the technology-intensive nature of crypto businesses, FINMA places
particular emphasis on IT security. Requirements are derived from FINMA Circular
2023/1 ("Operational resilience and BCM - banks") and applicable FINMA guidance.

10.1 IT Governance
- Board-level oversight of IT strategy and cybersecurity.
- Appointment of a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) or equivalent.
- Regular reporting to the board on IT risk and cybersecurity posture.

10.2 Cybersecurity
- Multi-layered defense architecture (defense in depth).
- Regular penetration testing by independent third parties (at least annually).
- Vulnerability management program with defined SLAs for remediation.
- Security Operations Center (SOC) or equivalent monitoring capability.
- Incident response plan with defined escalation procedures.

10.3 Private Key Management
- Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) for storing cryptographic keys.
- Multi-signature or threshold-signature schemes for transaction authorization.
- Geographic distribution of key material.
- Key ceremony procedures with multiple participants and audit trails.
- Disaster recovery procedures for key material.

10.4 Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery
- Business Continuity Plan (BCP) covering all critical functions.
- Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP) with defined Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs) and
  Recovery Point Objectives (RPOs).
- Regular testing of BCP and DRP (at least annually).
- Geographic redundancy of critical systems.

- Compliance with the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection (FADP; SR 235.1).
- Data classification and handling procedures.
- Encryption of sensitive data at rest and in transit.
- Access control based on the principle of least privilege.


11. ONGOING SUPERVISION AND REPORTING
---------------------------------------

Once licensed, banks are subject to continuous FINMA supervision:

11.1 Regulatory Reporting
- Monthly: Liquidity reporting (LCR, NSFR).
- Quarterly: Capital adequacy reporting, large exposure reporting.
- Semi-annually: Interest rate risk in the banking book.
- Annually: Comprehensive regulatory audit by the FINMA-recognized auditor.
- Ad hoc: Immediate reporting of material events (cyber incidents, significant
  losses, changes in management or ownership).

11.2 Supervisory Interactions
- Regular supervisory meetings with FINMA (frequency depends on the bank's
  risk category and systemic importance).
- Thematic reviews and on-site inspections by FINMA or mandated auditors.
- Participation in FINMA surveys and data collections.

11.3 Ongoing Obligations
- Maintain minimum capital requirements at all times.
- Comply with all applicable FINMA circulars and guidance.
- Notify FINMA of any material changes in business model, ownership, or
  governance structure.
- Maintain adequate insurance coverage.
- Contribute to the deposit protection scheme (esisuisse) for covered deposits
  up to CHF 100,000 per depositor.

11.4 Enforcement
- FINMA has broad enforcement powers, including the ability to issue orders,
  impose conditions on the license, appoint supervisory agents (Beauftragter),
  restrict business activities, or revoke the license.
- Violations of banking law may result in criminal prosecution by the relevant
  authorities.


12. APPLICATION TO CRYPTO BUSINESSES
--------------------------------------

Several Swiss crypto companies have obtained full banking licenses, including
SEBA Bank (now AMINA Bank) and Sygnum Bank, both licensed in 2019. Their
experience provides useful precedents:

12.1 Crypto-Native Banking Activities
Licensed crypto banks typically offer:
- Custody of digital assets with institutional-grade security.
- Trading and execution services for crypto assets.
- Fiat on-ramp and off-ramp services.
- Tokenization of traditional assets.
- Staking services (subject to regulatory classification).
- Crypto-collateralized lending.

12.2 Specific FINMA Expectations for Crypto Banks
- Technology due diligence: FINMA expects thorough technical documentation of
  blockchain interactions, smart contract risks, and wallet architecture.
- Asset classification: Each crypto asset offered must be classified under
  Swiss law (payment token, utility token, or asset token per FINMA ICO
  Guidelines 2018).
- Staking and DeFi: Activities involving staking or DeFi protocols require
  specific risk assessments and board-level approval.
- Cross-border: Crypto banks must address cross-border regulatory risks given
  the borderless nature of blockchain networks.

12.3 Advantages of the Banking License for Crypto Businesses
- Full range of financial services without restrictions.
- Deposit protection under esisuisse for fiat deposits.
- Credibility and trust with institutional clients.
- Access to Swiss National Bank (SNB) payment systems (SIC/euroSIC).
- Ability to issue covered bonds and participate in interbank markets.

12.4 Challenges and Considerations
- High capital requirements (CHF 10M minimum, often higher in practice).
- Extensive regulatory burden and ongoing compliance costs.
- Long application timeline (12-24 months).
- Need for experienced banking professionals in governance roles.
- Annual regulatory audit costs (CHF 200,000 to CHF 500,000+).

In summary, the full banking license is the gold standard of Swiss financial
regulation and provides crypto businesses with the broadest possible scope of
authorized activities. However, the significant capital, organizational, and
compliance requirements mean it is typically pursued only by well-funded entities
with institutional ambitions. Smaller or more focused crypto businesses may find
the FinTech license or SRO membership more appropriate as initial steps.
