SWISS LIQUIDITY ORDINANCE (LiqO / LiqV) — COMPREHENSIVE GUIDE
================================================================

1. OVERVIEW AND LEGAL BASIS
---------------------------
The Ordinance on the Liquidity of Banks (Liquiditaetsverordnung, LiqV;
SR 952.06), commonly referred to as the Liquidity Ordinance (LiqO), was
enacted by the Swiss Federal Council on 30 November 2012 and entered into
force on 1 January 2013. NSFR provisions were added effective 1 July 2021.

Legal hierarchy:
- Primary law: Banking Act (BankA; SR 952.0), Art. 4 BankA
- Federal Council ordinance: LiqO (SR 952.06)
- FINMA implementing regulation: FINMA Circular 2015/2 "Liquidity risks –
  banks" (margin nos. 1–520)
- Planned replacement: LiqO-FINMA ordinance (consultation launched July 2025,
  expected to replace Circular 2015/2 with a formal FINMA ordinance)

The LiqO transposes the Basel III liquidity framework into Swiss law,
implementing both the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and the Net Stable
Funding Ratio (NSFR) as set by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.

Scope (Art. 1 LiqO): all banks licensed under BankA, account-holding
securities firms, financial groups of banks, and foreign bank branches
in Switzerland (with certain adjustments).

Purpose (Art. 2 LiqO): banks must at all times hold sufficient liquid assets
to meet payment obligations, including under stress conditions, and maintain
adequately measured, sustainable liquidity reserves and appropriate financing
structures.


2. LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK (QUALITATIVE REQUIREMENTS)
------------------------------------------------------------------
Articles 5–10 LiqO; FINMA Circular 2015/2 margin nos. 1–100.

Art. 5 — General risk management: banks shall manage liquidity risks
proportionate to their size, type, scope, complexity, and riskiness of
business activities, at both entity and group level.

Art. 6 — Identification and monitoring: banks must establish processes and
systems for identifying, measuring, managing, and monitoring liquidity risks.
These must ensure sufficient liquidity at all times, unimpaired payment and
settlement systems, and early warning indicators.

Art. 7 — Risk mitigation: banks shall maintain a limit system covering
counterparties, instrument types, markets, and currencies, plus a financing
structure with diversified funding sources and maturities. Planned amendment
to Art. 7 para. 1 (effective 1 January 2027): mandatory liquidity and
financial planning as part of the TBTF reform package.

Art. 8 — Stress testing: banks must define and run stress scenarios including
institution-specific (name crisis), market-wide, and combined shocks. Must
account for off-balance sheet exposures and contingent funding obligations
from securitization vehicles and special purpose entities.

Art. 9 — Contingency funding plan: every bank must have a plan setting out
strategies and measures for addressing liquidity shortfalls in stress
situations. The plan must be reviewed and updated at least annually.

Art. 10 — Board and senior management responsibilities: approve liquidity
risk strategy and risk tolerance; ensure adequate resources for liquidity
risk management; oversee and review liquidity positions regularly; receive
timely and relevant liquidity risk reporting.


3. LIQUIDITY COVERAGE RATIO (LCR)
-----------------------------------
Articles 12–17e LiqO; FINMA Circular 2015/2 margin nos. 101–320.

Art. 12 — Obligation: all banks licensed under BankA must comply with LCR.

Art. 13 — LCR calculation:
    LCR = HQLA / Total Net Cash Outflows over 30 calendar days
A bank fulfills LCR requirements if the quotient is at least 1 (LCR >= 100%).

Art. 14 — Stress scenario assumptions: combined idiosyncratic and market-wide
shock resulting in partial loss of retail/wholesale deposits, loss of secured
short-term financing, derivative outflows from credit downgrades, increased
secured lending haircuts, drawdowns on committed facilities, and obligations
to fund contractual asset purchases.

Art. 14a — LCR must be calculated at least monthly. FINMA may require more
frequent calculation (daily or weekly) for systemically important banks
(Categories 1 and 2).


4. HIGH-QUALITY LIQUID ASSETS (HQLA)
--------------------------------------
Articles 15–15e LiqO; Annex 1 LiqO.

Art. 15 — General requirements: HQLA must be unencumbered, freely available,
and readily convertible to cash in private markets without legal, regulatory,
or operational restrictions. Operational requirements: under treasury or
liquidity management control, not co-mingled with trading positions,
periodically tested for market access via repo or outright sale.

Composition limits:
- Level 1 assets: no cap (unlimited inclusion)
- Level 2 assets (combined 2A + 2B): maximum 40% of total HQLA
- Level 2B assets: maximum 15% of total HQLA

Art. 15a — Level 1 HQLA (0% haircut):
- Coins and banknotes
- Central bank reserves (including SNB reserves)
- Sovereign/central bank securities assigned 0% risk weight (BIS, IMF, ECB,
  European Commission, multilateral development banks)
- Swiss Confederation bonds and debt instruments
- Domestic sovereign or central bank debt in local currency

Art. 15b — Level 2 HQLA:
Level 2A (15% haircut):
- Sovereign/MDB securities assigned 20% risk weight
- Corporate debt securities rated AA- or better
- Covered bonds rated AA- or better per Art. 15d requirements
- Securities issued by Swiss cantons, cities, communities, and the
  Emissionszentrale Schweizer Gemeinden (ESG) meeting eligibility criteria

Level 2B (minimum 50% haircut):
- Corporate debt securities rated A+ to BBB-
- Qualifying residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS)
- Common equity shares in major stock indices (e.g., Swiss Market Index/SMI)

Art. 15c — Alternative Liquidity Approaches (ALA): where domestic HQLA
supply is insufficient, FINMA may permit committed SNB liquidity facilities
or foreign currency HQLA with appropriate FX haircuts.

Art. 15d — Covered bond requirements: must be subject to Pfandbriefgesetz
public supervision, not self-issued or by affiliated entities, risk weight
<= 20%, minimum credit rating AA- or equivalent.

Art. 15e — All HQLA must be periodically monetized through repo or sale to
test market access and the bank's liquidation capability.


5. CASH OUTFLOWS CALCULATION
------------------------------
Art. 16 LiqO; Annex 2 LiqO; Circular 2015/2 margin nos. 200–280.

Total expected cash outflows are calculated by multiplying outstanding
balances by outflow rates specified in Annex 2.

Key outflow categories and rates:
Retail deposits:
- Stable deposits (insured, established relationship): 5%
- Less stable deposits: 10%
- Term deposits > 30 days with no early withdrawal option: 0%

Unsecured wholesale funding:
- Operational deposits (clearing, custody, cash management): 25%
- Non-operational deposits, non-financial corporates: 40%
- Non-operational deposits, financial institutions: 100%
- Other unsecured wholesale funding: 100%

Secured funding:
- Secured by Level 1 HQLA: 0%; by Level 2A: 15%; by Level 2B: 25–50%
- All other secured funding: 100%

Additional outflows:
- Downgrade triggers (up to 3 notches): 100% (Circular margin no. 255)
- Committed facilities: retail/SME 5%, corporates 10% (credit) / 30%
  (liquidity), banks and financial institutions 40%
- Derivative cash outflows: contractual plus historical lookback for
  collateral calls


6. CASH INFLOWS CALCULATION
-----------------------------
Art. 17 LiqO; Annex 3 LiqO; Circular 2015/2 margin nos. 281–320.

Inflows are calculated by multiplying contractual receivables by inflow
rates per Annex 3. Total inflows are capped at 75% of total expected
outflows, requiring a minimum 25% HQLA buffer regardless of inflow levels.

Key inflow categories and rates:
- Reverse repos backed by Level 1 HQLA: 0% (already counted as HQLA)
- Backed by Level 2A: 15%; Level 2B: 50%; other collateral: 100%
- Performing loans — retail/SME and non-financial wholesale: 50%
- Financial institution counterparties: 100%

FINMA may set bespoke inflow/outflow rates deviating from Annexes 2 and 3
for specific banks or categories (Art. 17b LiqO).


7. NET STABLE FUNDING RATIO (NSFR)
------------------------------------
Articles 17f–17s LiqO; Annexes 4–5; Circular 2015/2 margin nos. 321–520.
Effective 1 July 2021 (Federal Council amendment of 11 September 2020).

Art. 17f — All banks must comply, except those exempt under the small banks
regime (Art. 17e LiqO referencing Art. 47a CAO).

Art. 17g — NSFR = Available Stable Funding (ASF) / Required Stable Funding
(RSF). Minimum >= 1 (i.e., NSFR >= 100%).

Art. 17h — Available Stable Funding (ASF) per Annex 4:
- Regulatory capital (CET1, AT1, Tier 2 > 1 year), liabilities > 1 year: 100%
- Stable retail/SME deposits < 1 year: 95%
- Less stable retail/SME deposits < 1 year: 90%
- Wholesale non-financial corporate funding < 1 year: 50%
- Operational deposits: 50%
- Other liabilities and capital instruments < 6 months: 0%

Art. 17i — Required Stable Funding (RSF) per Annex 5:
- Cash, central bank reserves, unencumbered Level 1 HQLA: 0%
- Unencumbered Level 2A HQLA: 15%; Level 2B: 50%
- HQLA encumbered for exceptional central bank operations: 0% (Level 1,
  Annex 5 item 1.8) / 15% (Level 2, Annex 5 item 3.3)
- Loans to financial institutions < 6 months: 10%
- Performing corporate loans < 1 year: 50%
- Residential mortgages >= 1 year with risk weight <= 35%: 65%
- Other loans >= 1 year: 85%; all other assets: 100%
- Off-balance sheet irrevocable credit/liquidity facilities: 5%


8. LIQUIDITY STRESS TESTING REQUIREMENTS
------------------------------------------
Art. 8 LiqO; Circular 2015/2 margin nos. 60–85.

Types of required stress tests:
- Short-term (up to 30 days) aligned with LCR scenarios
- Medium-term (30 days to 1 year) covering structural funding risks
- Combined idiosyncratic and market-wide scenarios

Stress factors to consider: significant credit downgrade (up to 3 notches),
retail/wholesale deposit loss, increased secured funding haircuts, large
margin calls, facility drawdowns, loss of market access, FX convertibility
and access restrictions.

Frequency by FINMA category:
- Category 1–2: at least quarterly, with ad hoc tests as needed
- Category 3: at least semi-annually
- Category 4–5: at least annually

Governance: stress test results must be reported to the board and senior
management, integrated into the contingency funding plan, and assumptions
reviewed regularly. FINMA also conducts its own supervisory stress tests
for banks in Categories 1 and 2.


9. INTRADAY LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT
----------------------------------
Art. 7 LiqO; Circular 2015/2 margin nos. 86–100.

Banks must meet payment and settlement obligations on a timely basis during
each business day, with tools tailored to risk profile, business activities,
and systemic importance.

Specific requirements:
- Measure expected daily gross inflows/outflows
- Anticipate critical settlement times and prioritize time-critical payments
- Maintain sufficient intraday liquidity buffers
- Access SNB standing facilities for intraday credit where applicable
- Demonstrate ability to manage intraday stress events

Monitoring tools: real-time payment flow monitoring, intraday liquidity
usage metrics, available buffer tracking, time-specific obligation tracking.

Enhanced requirements for Category 1–2 banks: daily intraday monitoring
and reporting, simulation of intraday stress events, direct participant
reporting to FINMA on intraday metrics.


10. REPORTING OBLIGATIONS
---------------------------
Art. 3–4 LiqO; Circular 2015/2 margin nos. 420–480.

Art. 3 — FINMA defines reporting templates. Cut-off date: last calendar
day of each month (LCR) or relevant period (NSFR).

LCR reporting frequency:
- Category 1–2 (systemically important): monthly, with daily capability
  on request
- Category 3–5: monthly (simplified template for SBR banks)
- Submission: within 30 business days (reduced for SIBs)

NSFR reporting frequency:
- Category 1–2: monthly
- Category 3: quarterly
- Category 4–5: semi-annually (exempt SBR banks need not report)

Additional reports: funding concentration metrics, currency-specific LCR
for all significant currencies, maturity mismatch profiles, intraday
liquidity metrics (Category 1–2 only).

Art. 4 — SNB may request additional liquidity data for monetary policy and
financial stability under the National Bank Act (SR 951.11). Data submitted
via SNB eSurvey/EMI and/or FINMA EHP platform.


11. FINMA CATEGORY-SPECIFIC THRESHOLDS
----------------------------------------
FINMA assigns banks to five supervisory categories per Annex 3 of the
Banking Ordinance (BO; SR 952.02), based on total assets, assets under
management, privileged deposits, and required capital.

Category 1 — Systemically important banks (G-SIBs/D-SIBs):
Total assets typically > CHF 250 billion. Very high risk. Full LCR/NSFR
with daily monitoring capability. Enhanced stress testing and intraday
reporting. Subject to TBTF requirements. Example: UBS.

Category 2 — Large and important banks:
Total assets typically CHF 50–250 billion. High risk. Full LCR/NSFR with
monthly reporting. Enhanced stress testing. Examples: Raiffeisen, ZKB.

Category 3 — Medium-large banks:
Total assets typically CHF 15–50 billion. Significant risk. LCR monthly,
NSFR quarterly reporting. Semi-annual stress testing minimum.

Category 4 — Medium-sized banks:
Total assets typically CHF 1–15 billion. Medium risk. Full LCR required.
NSFR required unless admitted to SBR. NSFR reporting semi-annually.
Eligible for small banks regime.

Category 5 — Small banks:
Total assets typically < CHF 1 billion. Low risk. LCR required (simplified
calculation under SBR). NSFR exempt under SBR. Supervised primarily via
quantitative indicators.

Small Banks Regime (SBR) — Art. 47a CAO:
Categories 4 and 5 banks that are well-capitalized and liquid may apply.
Benefits: NSFR exemption (Art. 17e LiqO), simplified LCR calculation,
reduced reporting. Indicative criteria: leverage ratio significantly above
minimum, LCR consistently above 110%, no complex activities, stable and
diversified funding base.


12. GROUP-LEVEL VS. ENTITY-LEVEL REQUIREMENTS
-----------------------------------------------
Art. 5 LiqO; Circular 2015/2 margin nos. 10–25.

Entity level: each bank in Switzerland must individually comply with LCR,
NSFR, and qualitative requirements (Arts. 5–10). Entity-level reporting
is required.

Group level: financial groups with a Swiss parent must also comply on a
consolidated basis. Consolidated stress testing, contingency planning, and
group-level reporting are required alongside entity-level reporting.

Cross-border: FINMA may require separate LCR for material foreign
subsidiaries or branches. Banks must assess cross-jurisdictional asset
access and inform FINMA during stress. Where an entity is mainly funded
by foreign branches, FINMA may exclude those inflows from LCR (Art. 17b).
Transferability restrictions from foreign regulators must be reflected in
liquidity planning.

Waivers: FINMA may grant partial entity-level LCR waivers within a group
if enforceable group-internal liquidity support mechanisms exist.


13. EMERGENCY LIQUIDITY PLANNING
----------------------------------
Art. 9 LiqO; Circular 2015/2 margin nos. 50–59.

Every bank must maintain a contingency funding plan (CFP) that includes:
- Clear escalation procedures and quantitative trigger levels
- Defined roles and responsibilities for crisis management
- Communication strategies (internal, external, regulators, SNB, markets)
- Identified emergency funding sources: asset sales/repos, SNB emergency
  liquidity assistance (ELA), outflow deferral, lending curtailment
- Estimated timing and amounts of liquidity raisable under stress
- Legal and operational steps required to access emergency funding

Review and testing: CFP must be reviewed and updated at least annually,
with simulation exercises recommended. Results reported to the board.

For Categories 1 and 2: CFP must integrate with the TBTF recovery plan
(Art. 64 BankA, FINMA Circular 2019/3).

Banks must immediately notify FINMA if liquidity falls below established
internal trigger levels or if the CFP is activated. FINMA may require
specific measures to restore liquidity buffers.


14. CONCENTRATION LIMITS
--------------------------
Art. 7 LiqO; Circular 2015/2 margin nos. 30–45.

Banks must ensure diversification of funding across:
- Counterparties (no excessive reliance on single/few providers)
- Instrument types (retail, wholesale, secured, unsecured, capital market)
- Markets and geographies
- Currencies
- Maturities (avoid excessive short-term concentration)

A formal limit system is required covering individual counterparties, groups
of connected counterparties, instruments, and currencies. Limits must be
board-approved, continuously monitored, and breaches escalated to senior
management. Concentration metrics are reported alongside LCR/NSFR data.

Related: under risk diversification rules (Art. 97 CAO), maximum risk
concentration per counterparty is 25% of a bank's eligible capital.


15. CURRENCY-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS
------------------------------------
Art. 17a LiqO; Circular 2015/2 margin nos. 300–325.

Significant currency threshold: a foreign currency is significant if
liabilities in that currency amount to >= 5% of total liabilities
(margin no. 325). Banks must calculate and monitor LCR separately in
each significant currency, respecting the 15%/40% HQLA composition limits.

Currency mismatch management: banks must assess ability to raise funds and
convert HQLA in each significant currency under stress. FX risk from HQLA/
outflow mismatches must be incorporated into stress tests. Separate FX stress
tests and specific CFP measures are required for each significant currency.

NSFR: calculated on an all-currency basis; FINMA may require supplementary
currency-specific NSFR monitoring for banks with material mismatches.

CHF specifics: Swiss Confederation bonds qualify as Level 1 HQLA without
cap. The SNB provides intraday and overnight CHF liquidity facilities.
Where CHF HQLA supply is limited, the ALA mechanism (Art. 15c) may apply.


16. TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS AND RECENT AMENDMENTS
----------------------------------------------------
LCR phase-in: 60% (2015), 70% (2016), 80% (2017), 90% (2018), full 100%
from 1 January 2019. NSFR: full 100% from 1 July 2021, no phase-in.
NSFR reporting obligations commenced 1 July 2021 (monthly Cat. 1–2,
quarterly Cat. 3, semi-annually Cat. 4–5).

Small banks regime expansion (2022–2023): simplified LCR calculation and
NSFR exemption for eligible Category 4 and 5 banks under Art. 47a CAO.

Planned future amendments (as of 2025):
