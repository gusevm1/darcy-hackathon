SWISS LIQUIDITY ORDINANCE (LiqO / LiqV) — COMPREHENSIVE GUIDE
================================================================

1. OVERVIEW AND LEGAL BASIS
---------------------------
The Ordinance on the Liquidity of Banks (Liquiditaetsverordnung, LiqV;
SR 952.06), commonly referred to as the Liquidity Ordinance (LiqO), was
enacted by the Swiss Federal Council on 30 November 2012 and entered into
force on 1 January 2013. NSFR provisions were added effective 1 July 2021.

Legal hierarchy:
- Primary law: Banking Act (BankA; SR 952.0), Art. 4 BankA
- Federal Council ordinance: LiqO (SR 952.06)
- FINMA implementing regulation: FINMA Circular 2015/2 "Liquidity risks –
  banks" (margin nos. 1–520)
- Planned replacement: LiqO-FINMA ordinance (consultation launched July 2025)

Scope (Art. 1 LiqO): all banks under BankA, account-holding securities
firms, financial groups of banks, and foreign bank branches in Switzerland.

Purpose (Art. 2 LiqO): banks must at all times hold sufficient liquid assets
to meet payment obligations, including under stress, and maintain sustainable
liquidity reserves and appropriate financing structures.

2. LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK (QUALITATIVE REQUIREMENTS)
------------------------------------------------------------------
Articles 5–10 LiqO; FINMA Circular 2015/2 margin nos. 1–100.

Art. 5 — General: banks shall manage liquidity risks proportionate to their
size, type, scope, complexity, and riskiness, at entity and group level.
Art. 6 — Identification and monitoring: processes for measuring, managing,
and monitoring liquidity risks; early warning indicators required.
Art. 7 — Risk mitigation: limit system covering counterparties, instruments,
markets, currencies; diversified funding sources and maturities. Planned
amendment (effective 2027): mandatory liquidity and financial planning.
Art. 8 — Stress testing: institution-specific, market-wide, and combined
stress scenarios; include off-balance sheet and contingent obligations.
Art. 9 — Contingency funding plan: strategies for liquidity shortfalls;
annual review and update required.
Art. 10 — Board and senior management: approve liquidity risk strategy and
risk tolerance; ensure adequate resources; receive timely reporting.

3. LIQUIDITY COVERAGE RATIO (LCR)
-----------------------------------
Articles 12–17e LiqO; FINMA Circular 2015/2 margin nos. 101–320.

Art. 12 — All banks must comply with the LCR.
Art. 13 — LCR = HQLA / Total Net Cash Outflows over 30 days. Minimum: >= 1
(i.e., LCR >= 100%).

shock: partial loss of retail/wholesale deposits, loss of secured financing,
derivative outflows from downgrades, increased haircuts, facility drawdowns.
Art. 14a — Calculated at least monthly; FINMA may require daily/weekly for
Categories 1 and 2.

4. HIGH-QUALITY LIQUID ASSETS (HQLA)
--------------------------------------
Articles 15–15e LiqO; Annex 1 LiqO.

Art. 15 — HQLA must be unencumbered, freely available, readily convertible
to cash. Operational requirements: under treasury control, not co-mingled
with trading, periodically tested via repo or sale.

risk weight <= 20%, rated AA- or better.

5. CASH OUTFLOWS CALCULATION
------------------------------
Art. 16 LiqO; Annex 2 LiqO; Circular 2015/2 margin nos. 200–280.

6. CASH INFLOWS CALCULATION
-----------------------------
Art. 17 LiqO; Annex 3 LiqO; Circular 2015/2 margin nos. 281–320.

Inflows = contractual receivables x inflow rates per Annex 3.
Cap: total inflows capped at 75% of total outflows (minimum 25% HQLA).

Key rates: reverse repos backed by Level 1: 0%; Level 2A: 15%; Level 2B:
50%; other collateral: 100%. Performing loans — retail/SME and non-financial
wholesale: 50%; financial institutions: 100%.

FINMA may set bespoke inflow/outflow rates per Art. 17b LiqO.

7. NET STABLE FUNDING RATIO (NSFR)

8. LIQUIDITY STRESS TESTING REQUIREMENTS
------------------------------------------
Art. 8 LiqO; Circular 2015/2 margin nos. 60–85.

Types: short-term (30 days, LCR-aligned), medium-term (30 days to 1 year),
combined idiosyncratic and market-wide scenarios.

Stress factors: credit downgrade (up to 3 notches), retail/wholesale deposit
loss, increased secured funding haircuts, margin calls, facility drawdowns,
loss of market access, FX restrictions.

Frequency by category:
- Category 1–2: at least quarterly (ad hoc as needed)
- Category 3: at least semi-annually
- Category 4–5: at least annually

Governance: results reported to board and senior management; integrated
into contingency funding plan; assumptions reviewed regularly.
FINMA conducts own supervisory stress tests for Categories 1 and 2.

9. INTRADAY LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT
----------------------------------
Art. 7 LiqO; Circular 2015/2 margin nos. 86–100.

Banks must meet payment/settlement obligations timely during each business
day. Requirements: measure daily gross inflows/outflows, anticipate critical
times, prioritize time-critical obligations, maintain intraday buffers,
access SNB standing facilities where applicable, demonstrate ability to
manage intraday stress impact.

Monitoring tools: real-time payment flow monitoring, intraday usage metrics,
buffer tracking, time-specific obligation monitoring.

Enhanced for Category 1–2: daily monitoring/reporting, intraday stress
simulations, direct FINMA reporting on intraday metrics.

10. REPORTING OBLIGATIONS
---------------------------
Art. 3–4 LiqO; Circular 2015/2 margin nos. 420–480.

LCR reporting (cut-off: month-end):
- Category 1–2: monthly (daily capability on request)
- Category 3–5: monthly (simplified template for SBR banks)

NSFR reporting:
- Category 1–2: monthly
- Category 3: quarterly
- Category 4–5: semi-annually (exempt SBR banks need not report)

Additional reports: funding concentration, currency-specific LCR, maturity
mismatch profiles, intraday metrics (Cat. 1–2).

Art. 4 — SNB may request additional data under the National Bank Act
(SR 951.11). Submitted via SNB eSurvey/EMI and/or FINMA EHP platform.

11. FINMA CATEGORY-SPECIFIC THRESHOLDS
----------------------------------------
FINMA assigns banks to five categories per Annex 3 Banking Ordinance
(BO; SR 952.02), based on total assets, assets under management, privileged
deposits, and required capital.

Category 1 (G-SIBs/D-SIBs): total assets typically > CHF 250bn; very high
risk; full LCR/NSFR with daily monitoring; enhanced stress testing and
intraday reporting; TBTF requirements apply. Example: UBS.

Category 2: total assets typically CHF 50–250bn; high risk; full LCR/NSFR,
monthly reporting; enhanced stress testing. Examples: Raiffeisen, ZKB.

Category 3: total assets typically CHF 15–50bn; significant risk; LCR
monthly, NSFR quarterly; semi-annual stress testing minimum.

Category 4: total assets typically CHF 1–15bn; medium risk; full LCR;
NSFR required unless in SBR; NSFR reporting semi-annually.

Category 5: total assets typically < CHF 1bn; low risk; LCR required
(simplified under SBR); NSFR exempt under SBR; quantitative supervision.

Small Banks Regime (Art. 47a CAO): Cat. 4–5 banks that are well-capitalized
and liquid may apply. Benefits: NSFR exemption (Art. 17e), simplified LCR,
reduced reporting. Criteria: leverage ratio above minimum, LCR > 110%,
no complex activities, stable diversified funding.

12. GROUP-LEVEL VS. ENTITY-LEVEL REQUIREMENTS
-----------------------------------------------
Art. 5 LiqO; Circular 2015/2 margin nos. 10–25.

Entity level: each Swiss bank must individually comply with LCR, NSFR,
and qualitative requirements. Entity-level reporting required.

Group level: financial groups with Swiss parent must also comply on
consolidated basis, including consolidated stress testing and contingency
planning. Group-level reporting required.

Cross-border: FINMA may require separate LCR for material foreign
subsidiaries/branches; banks must assess cross-jurisdictional asset access
and report to FINMA during stress. If entity mainly funded by foreign
branches, FINMA may exclude those inflows from LCR (Art. 17b).

Waivers: FINMA may grant partial entity-level LCR waivers within a group
if enforceable internal liquidity support exists.

13. EMERGENCY LIQUIDITY PLANNING
----------------------------------
Art. 9 LiqO; Circular 2015/2 margin nos. 50–59.

Contingency funding plan (CFP) must include:
- Escalation procedures and quantitative trigger levels
- Defined crisis management roles and responsibilities
- Communication strategies (internal, external, regulators, SNB)
- Emergency funding sources: asset sales/repos, SNB ELA, outflow deferral,
  lending curtailment
- Estimated timing and amounts of raisable liquidity
- Legal/operational steps to access emergency funding

Review: annual minimum; simulation exercises recommended; results reported
to board. For Cat. 1–2: CFP must align with TBTF recovery plan
(Art. 64 BankA, Circular 2019/3).

Notification: banks must immediately notify FINMA if liquidity falls below
internal triggers or CFP is activated.

14. CONCENTRATION LIMITS
--------------------------
Art. 7 LiqO; Circular 2015/2 margin nos. 30–45.

Banks must diversify funding across counterparties, instrument types,
markets, currencies, and maturities. Formal limit system required covering
individual counterparties, connected groups, instruments, and currencies.
Limits must be board-approved, continuously monitored, and breaches
escalated. Concentration metrics reported alongside LCR/NSFR data.

Related: maximum risk concentration per counterparty is 25% of eligible
capital under risk diversification rules (Art. 97 CAO).

15. CURRENCY-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS
------------------------------------
Art. 17a LiqO; Circular 2015/2 margin nos. 300–320.

Significant currency: foreign currency liabilities >= 5% of total
liabilities (margin no. 325). Banks must calculate and monitor LCR
separately in each significant currency, respecting the 15%/40% HQLA
composition limits.

Currency mismatch: banks must assess ability to raise funds and convert
HQLA under stress per currency; FX risk in stress tests; separate FX
stress tests and CFP measures for each significant currency.

NSFR: primarily all-currency; FINMA may require currency-specific NSFR
monitoring for material mismatches.

CHF specifics: Confederation bonds are Level 1 HQLA without cap; SNB
provides intraday/overnight CHF facilities; ALA (Art. 15c) applies where
CHF HQLA supply is limited.

16. TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS
-----------------------------
LCR phase-in: 60% (2015), 70% (2016), 80% (2017), 90% (2018), 100% (2019).
NSFR: full 100% from 1 July 2021 (no phase-in).
SBR expansion: 2022–2023 with simplified LCR and NSFR exemption for
eligible Cat. 4–5 banks.

Planned amendments (2025+):
- Art. 7 para. 1: mandatory liquidity/financial planning (eff. 2027)
- LiqO-FINMA: replacing Circular 2015/2 (consultation closing Sept 2025)

Post-Credit Suisse reforms under review: LCR 30-day horizon adequacy,
enhanced intraday monitoring for SIBs, holding company liquidity
requirements, cross-border transferability, mandatory financial planning.
