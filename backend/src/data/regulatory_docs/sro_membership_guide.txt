SELF-REGULATORY ORGANIZATION (SRO) MEMBERSHIP GUIDE
Comprehensive Guide to SRO Affiliation for Financial Intermediaries in Switzerland

================================================================================
1. WHAT IS AN SRO IN SWISS FINANCIAL REGULATION?
================================================================================

1.1 Definition and Legal Basis

A Self-Regulatory Organization (SRO, Selbstregulierungsorganisation) is a
private-law organization recognized by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory
Authority (FINMA) under Art. 24 of the Anti-Money Laundering Act (AMLA, SR 955.0)
to supervise the compliance of its member financial intermediaries with AML/CFT
due diligence obligations.

SROs are a distinctively Swiss regulatory feature — a form of delegated
supervision that leverages industry expertise while maintaining FINMA oversight.
They represent the primary supervisory mechanism for non-prudentially supervised
financial intermediaries in Switzerland.

1.2 Legal Framework

The SRO system is governed by:
- AMLA Art. 14 (obligation to affiliate with an SRO)
- AMLA Art. 18 (requirements for SRO recognition)
- AMLA Art. 24–27 (SRO duties and FINMA oversight of SROs)
- AMLO Art. 19–23 (detailed provisions on SRO operations)
- FINMA Circular 2023/1 "Self-regulatory organizations" (revised)

================================================================================
2. ROLE OF SROs UNDER AMLA
================================================================================

2.1 Core Functions

SROs perform the following functions:
(a) Standard-setting: Issuing detailed AML regulations (subject to FINMA
    approval) that implement the general due diligence obligations of AMLA for
    their members.
(b) Admission control: Vetting applicants to ensure they meet minimum standards
    for AML compliance before admitting them as members.
(c) Ongoing supervision: Monitoring members' compliance with AML obligations
    through regular and ad hoc audits.
(d) Enforcement: Taking disciplinary action against non-compliant members,
    including warnings, fines, suspension, or expulsion.
(e) Reporting: Informing FINMA of serious violations or concerns about members.

2.2 Relationship with FINMA

FINMA oversees SROs and:
- Recognizes and can revoke recognition of SROs
- Approves SRO regulations and amendments
- Conducts periodic reviews of SRO effectiveness
- Receives reports from SROs on serious violations
- Can intervene directly if an SRO fails to act

SROs act as the first line of AML supervision, with FINMA functioning as the
meta-supervisor. This layered approach reduces FINMA's direct supervisory burden
while maintaining overall regulatory quality.

================================================================================
3. RECOGNIZED SROs IN SWITZERLAND
================================================================================

3.1 Active SROs (as of 2025)

Switzerland has several FINMA-recognized SROs, each with its own focus:

(a) VQF (Verein zur Qualitaetssicherung von Finanzdienstleistungen)
    - Largest SRO in Switzerland with over 4,000 members
    - Generalist: covers all types of financial intermediaries
    - Particularly active in crypto/blockchain sector
    - Based in Zug
    - Website: www.vqf.ch
    - Known for: Crypto-friendly approach, comprehensive rulebook

(b) PolyReg (PolyReg General Self-Regulatory Organisation)
    - Focuses on fintech, innovation, and technology-driven businesses
    - Smaller membership base, more personalized service
    - Strong in crypto and blockchain sectors
    - Based in Zurich
    - Website: www.polyreg.ch
    - Known for: Fintech specialization, startup-friendly

(c) SO-FIT (Self-Regulatory Organisation of Financial Intermediaries in the
    Canton of Ticino, formerly OAR-G)
    - Regional focus on Ticino
    - Covers traditional financial intermediaries
    - Based in Lugano
    - Also admits crypto businesses

(d) AOOS (Aufsichtsorganisation Ostschweiz)
    - Regional SRO for Eastern Switzerland
    - Smaller, traditional membership

(e) SRO-SVV (Self-Regulatory Organisation of Swiss Insurance Association)
    - Sector-specific: insurance intermediaries
    - Not typically relevant for crypto businesses

(f) SRO-SAV/SNV (Sector-specific SROs for lawyers, notaries, etc.)
    - Sector-specific, limited relevance for crypto

3.2 Choosing an SRO

For crypto and blockchain businesses, VQF and PolyReg are the most commonly
chosen SROs due to their experience with digital asset businesses and their
adapted rules for crypto-specific compliance challenges.

Key factors in choosing an SRO:
- Experience with your business type (crypto, payments, asset management, etc.)
- Admission timeline and process efficiency
- Fee structure (admission and ongoing)
- Quality of support and guidance
- Reputation with FINMA and in the market
- Language capabilities (German, French, Italian, English)

================================================================================
4. WHEN SRO MEMBERSHIP IS REQUIRED vs. FINMA LICENSE
================================================================================

4.1 SRO Membership Required

Financial intermediaries under Art. 2 para. 3 AMLA must either:
- Affiliate with a recognized SRO, OR
- Apply for FINMA direct supervision (Art. 14a AMLA)

SRO membership is typically the appropriate path for:
- Crypto exchanges (small to medium scale, not requiring a banking license)
- Crypto brokers and OTC desks
- Payment service providers (below FinTech license thresholds)
- Asset managers (non-CISA)
- Trust companies
- Money service businesses
- Crypto custody providers (below FinTech or banking thresholds)

4.2 When a FINMA License Is Required Instead or In Addition

SRO membership is NOT sufficient when the activity requires a prudential license:
- Banking license: Required for accepting public deposits commercially or
  operating an exchange with an order book (Art. 1 Banking Act)
- FinTech license: Required for accepting public deposits up to CHF 100M
  that are not invested or interest-bearing (Art. 1b Banking Act)
- DLT trading facility license: Required for operating a multilateral trading
  platform for DLT securities (Art. 73a FMIA)
- Securities firm license: Required for professional securities dealing or
  market making

Note: Holders of these FINMA licenses are supervised directly by FINMA for
AMLA purposes and do NOT need SRO membership. Their AMLA compliance is governed
by AMLO-FINMA.

4.3 Dual Requirements

Some businesses may need both:
- An SRO membership for certain activities (e.g., crypto brokerage)
- A FINMA license for other activities (e.g., deposit-taking)

In practice, FINMA licensing supersedes SRO membership: once a FINMA license is
obtained, the licensed entity is directly supervised by FINMA for all activities.

================================================================================
5. SRO APPLICATION PROCESS — STEP BY STEP

- Auditor reviews client files, transaction monitoring, policies, training,
  SAR filings, and organizational measures
- Audit findings are reported to the SRO
- Members must remediate deficiencies within specified deadlines
- Audit frequency: annually for higher-risk members, biennially for lower-risk

================================================================================
9. COMMON REJECTION REASONS
================================================================================

Applications are most commonly rejected or delayed due to:

1. Incomplete documentation: Missing corporate or personnel documents
2. Inadequate AML framework: Policies that are generic, copy-pasted, or
   not tailored to the specific business
3. Unqualified personnel: Compliance officer lacks relevant experience or
   qualifications
4. Fit and proper concerns: Criminal history, bankruptcy, or regulatory
   sanctions involving directors or key personnel
5. No Swiss nexus: Business has no genuine Swiss presence (substance)
6. Unclear business model: Business plan does not clearly describe activities
   or the associated ML/TF risks
7. Insufficient capitalization: Lack of financial resources to sustain
   operations and compliance
8. High-risk elements without adequate controls: Offshore clients, anonymous
   tokens, or cash-intensive operations without commensurate controls
9. Crypto-specific: Lack of blockchain analytics tools, inadequate wallet
   management procedures, or failure to address travel rule compliance

================================================================================
11. WHEN SRO MEMBERSHIP IS SUFFICIENT FOR CRYPTO BUSINESSES
================================================================================

SRO membership alone is sufficient when the crypto business:
- Does not accept public deposits (does not hold client fiat funds in a
  deposit-like manner exceeding the de minimis threshold of 20 clients or
  CHF 1 million)
- Does not operate an exchange with an order book
- Does not issue securities
- Provides services such as:
  - Crypto brokerage / OTC trading
  - Crypto-to-fiat and fiat-to-crypto exchange (without order book)
  - Non-custodial wallet services
  - Crypto advisory services with disposition powers
  - Crypto payment processing (within thresholds)
  - Small-scale custody (subject to deposit thresholds — see FINMA sandbox
    exemption for deposits under CHF 1 million from max 20 persons)

For larger or more complex operations, a FinTech license, banking license, or
DLT trading facility license is required in addition to (or instead of) SRO
membership.

================================================================================
12. PRACTICAL TIPS FOR APPLICANTS
================================================================================

1. Start early: Begin preparing documentation well before you need to operate.
2. Engage specialists: Hire a Swiss AML consultant or law firm experienced
   with SRO applications.
3. Tailor your AML framework: Generic policies are the #1 cause of delays.
   Your AML manual must specifically address YOUR business, YOUR risks, and
   YOUR procedures.
4. Invest in the compliance officer: The CO must have genuine qualifications
   and experience — not just a title.
5. Demonstrate Swiss substance: Have a real Swiss office, Swiss-resident
   directors, and operational activities in Switzerland.
6. Be transparent: Disclose all relevant information upfront. Surprises during
   the review process create delays and mistrust.
7. Budget for ongoing costs: SRO membership is not a one-time expense. Budget
   for annual fees, audits, training, and compliance infrastructure.
8. Prepare for the audit: The first external AML audit often comes within
   6–12 months of admission. Be ready.
