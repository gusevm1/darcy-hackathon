SWISS BANKING ORDINANCE (BankO / BankV) -- FULL REFERENCE
==========================================================
Verordnung ueber die Banken und Sparkassen (Bankenverordnung, BankV)
SR 952.02 | Enacted: 30 April 2014 | In force: 1 January 2015 (latest revision: 1 January 2025)
Issued by: Swiss Federal Council

================================================================================
1. OVERVIEW AND RELATIONSHIP TO THE BANKING ACT
================================================================================

1.1 Purpose

The Banking Ordinance (BankO, SR 952.02) is the principal implementing ordinance
of the Federal Act on Banks and Savings Banks (BankA / BankG, SR 952.0). While the
Banking Act establishes the overarching framework for bank licensing, supervision,
and depositor protection in Switzerland, the Banking Ordinance provides the
detailed rules and technical specifications required for the Act's application.

1.2 Subject Matter (Art. 1 BankO)

The BankO governs, for banks and persons as defined in Art. 1b BankA:
  (a) Requirements for obtaining a license to operate;
  (b) Organizational requirements;
  (c) Accounting and financial reporting requirements.

For banks specifically, the BankO additionally governs:
  (d) The deposit insurance scheme;
  (e) The transfer and liquidation of dormant assets.

For systemically important banks, the BankO also addresses:
  (f) Contingency planning, recovery, and resolution.

1.3 Scope of Application (Art. 2 BankO)

The BankO applies to banks, persons pursuant to Art. 1b BankA (fintech license
holders), private bankers, and savings banks. All of these entities are subject
to the detailed provisions elaborated in the BankO.

1.4 Hierarchy of Norms

The regulatory hierarchy for Swiss banking is:
  - Banking Act (BankA / BankG, SR 952.0) -- federal statute
  - Banking Ordinance (BankO / BankV, SR 952.02) -- Federal Council ordinance
  - Capital Adequacy Ordinance (CAO / ERV, SR 952.03) -- Federal Council ordinance
  - Liquidity Ordinance (LiqO / LiqV, SR 952.06) -- Federal Council ordinance
  - FINMA Ordinances and Circulars -- supervisory authority regulations
  - Self-regulation recognized by FINMA (e.g., CDB, esisuisse)

================================================================================
2. LICENSING PROVISIONS (Art. 1-14 BankO)
================================================================================

2.1 Definition of Banks (Art. 2 BankO)

Banks are entities that are primarily active in the financial sector and that:
  (a) Accept deposits from the public on a commercial basis; or
  (b) Refinance themselves from multiple sources to provide financing to an
      indeterminate number of persons or companies.

2.2 Non-Banks (Art. 3 BankO)

Art. 3 BankO defines what constitutes a non-bank, clarifying the boundary between
regulated and unregulated entities. Entities that do not meet the criteria for
banks or Art. 1b persons fall outside the scope of mandatory licensing under the
Banking Act, subject to the exceptions in Art. 5 and Art. 6 BankO.

2.3 Essential Group Companies (Art. 3a BankO)

Art. 3a BankO defines essential group companies as those whose activities are of
material importance for the continuation of systemically important functions.
This designation carries consequences for consolidated supervision and emergency
planning.

2.4 Financial Sector Activity (Art. 4 BankO)

Art. 4 BankO clarifies what constitutes activity in the financial sector. An
entity is deemed to be primarily active in the financial sector if a significant
portion of its revenue is derived from financial services, including deposit-taking,
lending, securities trading, fund management, or payment services.

2.5 Licensing Requirement

Under Art. 3 para. 1 BankA, any entity that accepts deposits from the public on
a commercial basis or publicly solicits such deposits requires a banking license
from FINMA. The BankO provides the detailed criteria for determining when these
thresholds are met (see Art. 5 and Art. 6 BankO).

================================================================================
3. DEFINITION OF PUBLIC DEPOSITS (Art. 5 BankO)
================================================================================

3.1 General Definition

Art. 5 para. 1 BankO defines public deposits (Publikumseinlagen) as all
liabilities to customers, except those specified in paragraphs 2 and 3 of
the same article. This is a broad, inclusive definition: any obligation to
repay funds received from the public is presumed to be a deposit unless it
falls within one of the enumerated exceptions.

3.2 Excluded Entities (Art. 5 para. 2 BankO)

Deposits from the following categories of persons or entities do NOT qualify
as public deposits:
  (a) Domestic and foreign banks or other state-supervised financial entities;
  (b) Qualified shareholders holding significant ownership stakes in the debtor;
  (c) Persons economically or familially connected to qualified shareholders;
  (d) Institutional investors with professional treasury operations;
  (e) Active and retired employees of the entity depositing with their employer;
  (f) Non-profit associations, foundations, or cooperatives not active in the
      financial sector, pursuing non-commercial or mutual-aid purposes, provided
      the deposit term is at least six months.

3.3 Excluded Instruments and Transactions (Art. 5 para. 3 BankO)

The following are also excluded from the definition of public deposits:
  (a) Funds representing contractual consideration or security deposits (e.g.,
      performance bonds, rental deposits);
  (b) Bonds and other standardized mass-issued debt instruments, provided
      proper investor disclosure has been made (prospectus obligation);
  (c) Non-interest-bearing settlement account balances used exclusively for
      settlement of client transactions in precious metals or securities,
      provided the settlement period does not exceed 60 days;
  (d) Funds connected to life insurance contracts or occupational pension
      arrangements;
  (e) Small prepayment amounts received for future delivery of goods or services,
      provided no interest is paid;
  (f) Funds whose repayment is guaranteed by a licensed Swiss bank.

3.4 Crypto-Based Assets (Art. 5a BankO)

Art. 5a BankO addresses the treatment of crypto-based assets. Custody of
crypto-based assets may constitute deposit-taking depending on how the
assets are held. If the custodian holds crypto assets on a collective
(omnibus) basis without segregation, the obligation to return equivalent
assets may qualify as a deposit. Individual segregated custody of crypto
assets, where the assets are held separately and can be individually
attributed to each client, does not constitute deposit-taking.

================================================================================
4. COMMERCIAL OPERATION AND ADVERTISING (Art. 6-7b BankO)
================================================================================

4.1 Commercial Operation (Art. 6 BankO)

A person operates on a commercial basis within the meaning of Art. 1 para. 2
BankA if that person:
  (a) Continuously accepts deposits from more than 20 persons; or
  (b) Publicly solicits the acceptance of deposits, even if fewer than 20
      deposits result from such solicitation.

4.2 Regulatory Sandbox Exception (Art. 6 para. 2-4 BankO)

The regulatory sandbox allows entities to accept deposits from the public
without any license, provided ALL of the following conditions are met:
  (a) The total aggregate amount of deposits accepted does not exceed
      CHF 1 million;
  (b) The deposits do not bear interest and are not otherwise remunerated;
  (c) The deposits are not invested or lent to third parties;
  (d) Depositors are informed before making a deposit that:
      - The entity is not supervised by FINMA;
      - The deposits are not covered by the deposit insurance scheme.

This sandbox provision was introduced on 1 January 2019 and is designed to
allow early-stage fintech businesses to test their models without the cost
and burden of a full licensing process. Once the CHF 1 million threshold
is breached, the entity must obtain either a fintech license (Art. 1b BankA)
or a full banking license.

4.3 Advertising (Art. 7 BankO)

Art. 7 BankO specifies when an entity is deemed to publicly solicit deposits.
Public solicitation includes advertising through any medium (print, online,
broadcast, or other channels) aimed at attracting deposit funds from the
public.

4.4 Information and Disclosure Obligations (Art. 7a-7b BankO)

Art. 7a BankO sets out information obligations that entities accepting deposits
must fulfill, including disclosure of the entity's regulatory status.
Art. 7b BankO prohibits misleading representations regarding the entity's
regulatory status, activities, or the nature of deposits.

================================================================================
5. EXCEPTIONS FROM LICENSING -- FINTECH LICENSE AND SANDBOX
================================================================================

5.1 Fintech License (Art. 1b BankA, implemented by Art. 14a-14g BankO)

The fintech license (also known as the "banking license light" or "innovation
license") was introduced on 1 January 2019 through Art. 1b BankA. It permits
the acceptance of public deposits up to CHF 100 million, subject to the
following restrictions:
  - Deposits may NOT be invested;
  - Deposits may NOT bear interest or be otherwise remunerated;
  - Deposits must be held in readily available form.

The fintech license is designed for innovative financial service providers
such as payment processors, crypto custodians, crowdfunding platforms, and
other businesses that accept client funds without engaging in traditional
credit intermediation or maturity transformation.

5.2 Organizational Requirements for Fintech License Holders (Art. 14a-14g BankO)

Art. 14a: Legal form, seat, and actual management must be in Switzerland.
          Eligible legal forms include AG, GmbH, or cooperative.

Art. 14b: Business scope must be clearly defined and limited to activities
          consistent with the fintech license.

Art. 14c: Business management must be conducted from Switzerland by at least
          two qualified persons (dual control principle).

Art. 14d: Governance organs (board of directors) with at least three members
          for an AG; members must be fit and proper.

Art. 14e: Compliance function and risk management must be established,
          proportionate to the size and complexity of the business.

Art. 14f: Deposit custody requirements, ensuring client deposits are held
          in a secure and identifiable manner.

Art. 14g: Conflicts of interest must be identified, managed, and disclosed
          through written policies.

5.3 Sandbox (Art. 6 para. 2-4 BankO)

See Section 4.2 above. The sandbox is not a license but an exemption from the
licensing requirement. It allows acceptance of up to CHF 1 million in public
deposits from an unlimited number of depositors, provided the conditions
described in Art. 6 para. 2-4 BankO are met.

5.4 Transition Pathways

  Sandbox --> Fintech License: When deposits exceed CHF 1 million or the entity
  wishes to scale beyond sandbox constraints.

  Fintech License --> Full Banking License: When deposits exceed CHF 100 million,
  or the entity wishes to invest deposits, pay interest, or engage in lending.

================================================================================
6. MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS (Art. 15-17a BankO)
================================================================================

6.1 New Banks (Art. 15 BankO)

Art. 15 BankO establishes the minimum capital requirements for newly licensed
banks. The minimum fully paid-up capital for a new bank is CHF 10 million.
This capital must be:
  - Composed of qualifying equity (share capital or cooperative capital);
  - Fully paid up at the time of licensing;
  - Not encumbered or pledged;
  - Available for unrestricted use by the bank.

FINMA may require higher initial capitalization depending on:
  - The scope, nature, and complexity of the planned activities;
  - The bank's risk profile;
  - Projected balance sheet growth;
  - International activities.

6.2 Conversions (Art. 16 BankO)

Art. 16 BankO addresses the minimum capital requirements for entities that
convert from another legal form into a bank. The CHF 10 million minimum
applies, but FINMA may consider existing capital and reserves when assessing
compliance.

6.3 Exceptions (Art. 17 BankO)

Art. 17 BankO provides that FINMA may, in specific cases, set a lower minimum
capital requirement if the entity's risk profile and business model justify
reduced capitalization. This exception is narrowly applied and typically
limited to niche or specialized institutions.

6.4 Fintech License Holders (Art. 17a BankO)

Art. 17a BankO establishes the minimum capital for fintech license holders
(Art. 1b BankA persons):
  - Minimum capital: CHF 300,000; or
  - 5% of accepted public deposits, whichever is higher.

The capital must be:
  - Fully paid up and maintained at all times;
  - Composed of qualifying capital (equity, retained earnings);
  - Not encumbered or pledged.

Example calculations:
  - At CHF 5 million in deposits:  5% = CHF 250,000 --> minimum CHF 300,000
  - At CHF 10 million in deposits: 5% = CHF 500,000
  - At CHF 50 million in deposits: 5% = CHF 2,500,000
  - At CHF 100 million in deposits: 5% = CHF 5,000,000

Note: Fintech license holders are NOT subject to the Capital Adequacy Ordinance
(CAO) Basel III requirements that apply to full banks. Instead, the BankO's own
minimum capital provisions apply directly.

================================================================================
7. ORGANIZATIONAL REQUIREMENTS (Art. 8-14 BankO)
================================================================================

7.1 Information on Persons and Stakeholders (Art. 8-8a BankO)

Art. 8 BankO requires banks to provide FINMA with comprehensive information on
all persons with significant roles, including board members, executive management,
qualified shareholders, and beneficial owners. Documentation must include CVs,
criminal record extracts, debt enforcement extracts, and proof of professional
qualifications.

Art. 8a BankO requires immediate notification to FINMA of any changes in material
facts relating to key persons or qualified shareholders.

7.2 Business Scope (Art. 9 BankO)

Art. 9 BankO requires that the bank's business scope be clearly defined in its
articles of association and organizational regulations. The business plan must
describe the planned activities, target markets, and risk appetite.

7.3 Business Management (Art. 10 BankO)

Art. 10 BankO establishes that:
  - Business management must be conducted effectively from Switzerland;
  - At least two qualified persons must be responsible for day-to-day management
    (dual control principle);
  - Management personnel must be fit and proper, possessing adequate professional
    qualifications and offering a guarantee of proper business conduct (Gewaehr
    fuer einwandfreie Geschaeftstaetigkeit).

7.4 Governing Bodies (Art. 11 BankO)

Art. 11 BankO sets requirements for the bank's organs:
  - Board of directors: minimum three members, majority independent;
  - The chairman of the board may not simultaneously serve as CEO;
  - Board committees required depending on size (audit committee mandatory;
    risk committee, compensation committee for larger institutions);
  - Board members must demonstrate individual and collective fitness and propriety.

7.5 Function Separation and Risk Management (Art. 12 BankO)

Art. 12 BankO mandates:
  - Clear organizational separation of lending, trading, asset management, and
    settlement/back-office functions;
  - An effective risk management framework with adequate authority and independence;
  - An internal control system (ICS) built on the three-lines-of-defense model:
    (1) Business units -- risk ownership;
    (2) Risk management and compliance -- independent oversight;
    (3) Internal audit -- independent assurance, reporting directly to the board.

7.6 Qualified Participations (Art. 13 BankO)

Art. 13 BankO requires notification and FINMA approval for qualified participations
(10% or more of capital or voting rights). Changes in qualified participations
must be notified to FINMA prior to their taking effect. FINMA may object to a
participation that jeopardizes the proper and sound management of the bank.

7.7 Private Bankers (Art. 14 BankO)

Art. 14 BankO contains specific provisions for private bankers organized as
partnerships, addressing their particular governance and liability structures.

================================================================================
8. PROPER BUSINESS CONDUCT
================================================================================

8.1 Guarantee of Proper Business Conduct (Gewaehr)

The Gewaehr requirement is a central principle of Swiss banking regulation.
Under Art. 3 para. 2 let. c BankA (implemented by the BankO), all persons
entrusted with the management, supervision, or control of a bank must offer a
guarantee of proper business conduct. This encompasses:
  - Good reputation (unbescholten);
  - Adequate professional qualifications and experience;
  - Absence of criminal convictions for financial crimes;
  - Absence of pending criminal or regulatory proceedings;
  - Adequate financial standing (no personal over-indebtedness).

8.2 Ongoing Obligation

The Gewaehr requirement is not merely a licensing condition but an ongoing
obligation. Banks must immediately notify FINMA if any key person no longer
meets the fit-and-proper standards. FINMA may require the removal of
individuals who fail to maintain the required standards.

8.3 Conflicts of Interest

Banks must establish written policies to identify, manage, and disclose
conflicts of interest. Transactions with related parties must be conducted at
arm's length and documented. Board members and executives must disclose all
outside activities and financial interests.

================================================================================
9. ONGOING LICENSING CONDITIONS
================================================================================

9.1 Continuous Compliance

A banking license is subject to continuous compliance with all licensing
conditions. FINMA monitors compliance through:
  - Regular supervisory reviews;
  - On-site inspections (planned and ad hoc);
  - Regulatory audit reports;
  - Thematic reviews and data collections.

9.2 Material Changes Requiring FINMA Notification (Art. 8a BankO)

Banks must notify FINMA before implementing material changes, including:
  - Changes to the board of directors or executive management;
  - Changes in qualified participations (10% or more);
  - Significant changes to the business model or scope of activities;
  - Outsourcing of material business functions;
  - Opening or closing of branches (domestic or foreign);
  - Changes to the articles of association.

9.3 FINMA Enforcement Powers

If licensing conditions are no longer met, FINMA may:
  - Issue binding orders requiring remediation;
  - Impose conditions or restrictions on the license;
  - Appoint a supervisory agent (Beauftragter) to oversee the bank;
  - Restrict specific business activities;
  - Revoke the banking license as a last resort.

================================================================================
10. REPORTING AND DISCLOSURE OBLIGATIONS
================================================================================

10.1 Regulatory Reporting

Banks must submit regular reports to FINMA and the Swiss National Bank (SNB):
  - Monthly: Liquidity reporting (LCR, NSFR) for certain categories of banks;
  - Quarterly: Capital adequacy reporting, large exposure reports;
  - Semi-annually: Balance sheet data, income statement data, interest rate
    risk in the banking book;
  - Annually: Audited annual financial statements, regulatory audit report,
    annual report.

10.2 Ad Hoc Reporting

Banks must report material events to FINMA without delay, including:
  - Significant operational incidents (cybersecurity breaches, system failures);
  - Significant financial losses or unexpected risk exposures;
  - Changes in management, board, or qualified participations;
  - Regulatory actions or investigations by foreign authorities;
  - Material litigation or legal proceedings.

10.3 Publication Obligations (Art. 32, Art. 41 BankO)

Banks must publish their annual financial statements and, where applicable,
consolidated financial statements. The publication requirements are designed
to ensure transparency for depositors, investors, and the public. FINMA may
specify additional disclosure requirements through circulars.

10.4 Fintech License Holders

Fintech license holders (Art. 1b persons) have proportionately reduced reporting
obligations, including annual audited financial statements, deposit volume reports,
and material change notifications.

================================================================================
11. ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (Art. 25-42 BankO)
================================================================================

11.1 Individual Financial Statements (Art. 25-32 BankO)

Art. 25 BankO: Banks must prepare annual financial statements comprising a
balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement, and notes. The statements
must comply with the applicable accounting framework.

Art. 26 BankO: Foundations and principles of accounting. Financial statements
must provide a reliable assessment of the bank's net assets, financial position,
and results (true and fair view principle for statutory individual accounts).
The principle of prudence applies.

Art. 27 BankO: Valuation and recognition rules, including provisions for the
valuation of financial instruments, loans, real estate, participations, and
intangible assets. Banks may form hidden reserves (stille Reserven) to
strengthen their resilience, a feature specific to Swiss accounting practice.

Art. 28 BankO: Minimum structure (Mindestgliederung) of the balance sheet and
income statement. Banks must follow the prescribed format for presenting their
financial statements, ensuring comparability across the banking sector.

Art. 29 BankO: Management report requirements for the fiscal year.

Art. 30 BankO: Content of the annual report, including qualitative disclosures
on the bank's activities, risk management, and governance.

Art. 31 BankO: Interim financial statements. Banks may be required to prepare
semi-annual or quarterly interim statements depending on their size and
supervisory category.

Art. 32 BankO: Publication requirements for individual financial statements.

11.2 Consolidated Financial Statements (Art. 33-41 BankO)

Art. 33 BankO: Banks that control one or more entities must prepare consolidated
financial statements.

Art. 34 BankO: Obligation to prepare consolidated statements applies to all
banks that are parent companies of a group.

Art. 35 BankO: Exceptions from the obligation to prepare consolidated statements
(e.g., for small groups meeting certain thresholds).

Art. 36 BankO: Facilitations for certain types of groups.

Art. 37 BankO: Minimum structure for consolidated financial statements.

Art. 38-39 BankO: Consolidated management report and annual report content.

Art. 40 BankO: Interim consolidated statements.

Art. 41 BankO: Publication of consolidated financial statements.

11.3 Internationally Recognized Standards (Art. 28 para. 2 BankO)

Banks may apply internationally recognized accounting standards (IFRS or
US GAAP) for their consolidated financial statements and for supplementary
individual financial statements prepared according to the true-and-fair-view
principle. However, statutory individual financial statements must follow the
Banking Ordinance's own accounting framework.

11.4 FINMA Accounting Ordinance (FINMA-AO)

The FINMA Accounting Ordinance (FINMA-RV, SR 952.024.1) provides further
detail on the preparation, structure, and publication of financial statements.
It implements the BankO's accounting provisions and specifies disclosure
requirements regarding capital, liquidity, interest rate risk, remuneration,
and corporate governance.

11.5 Implementation Provisions (Art. 42 BankO)

Art. 42 BankO authorizes FINMA to issue detailed regulations on accounting
matters, including the FINMA Accounting Ordinance and related circulars
(notably FINMA Circular 2020/1 "Accounting - banks").

================================================================================
12. AUDIT REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================

12.1 Regulatory Audit

All banks must appoint a FINMA-recognized audit firm as their regulatory
auditor. The regulatory audit covers:
  - Compliance with licensing conditions;
  - Organizational adequacy and internal controls;
  - Capital adequacy and risk management;
  - AML/KYC compliance;
  - Compliance with FINMA circulars and ordinances.

The regulatory audit report is submitted directly to FINMA and forms a
central element of ongoing supervision.

12.2 Financial Audit

In addition to the regulatory audit, banks are subject to an ordinary
financial audit under the Swiss Code of Obligations (CO). The financial audit
covers the accuracy and completeness of the annual financial statements.

12.3 Audit for Fintech License Holders

Fintech license holders (Art. 1b persons) are also subject to annual audit
by a FINMA-recognized audit firm, but the scope is proportionately reduced
compared to full banks, reflecting their simpler business models.

12.4 Special Audits

FINMA may order special audits at any time to investigate specific matters
of concern. The costs of special audits are typically borne by the audited
institution.

================================================================================
13. DEPOSITOR PROTECTION PROVISIONS (Art. 42a-43 BankO)
================================================================================

13.1 Overview

The Swiss depositor protection system is governed by Art. 37a-37h BankA and
implemented through Art. 42a-43 BankO. The system aims to protect small
depositors in the event of a bank insolvency.

13.2 Privileged Deposits (Art. 42a BankO)

Art. 42a BankO defines privileged deposits as those deposits that receive
preferential treatment in bank insolvency proceedings. Privileged deposits
are placed in the second bankruptcy class (zweite Konkursklasse) and are
paid out before general unsecured claims.

Privileged deposits include:
  - Savings deposits;
  - Current account balances;
  - Fixed-term deposits;
  - Custody account balances held in cash;
  - Deposits in Pillar 3a and vested benefits accounts (subject to separate
    treatment under Art. 42d BankO).

13.3 Privileged Amount (Art. 42b BankO)

Art. 42b BankO specifies that the privileged amount per depositor per bank
is CHF 100,000. To determine the privileged amount:
  - Individual balances across all accounts of the same depositor are summed;
  - Accrued interest in the depositor's favor is included;
  - Outstanding obligations (mortgages, loans, overdrafts) are NOT netted
    against the deposit balance for the purpose of determining the privileged
    amount.

13.4 Privileged Depositors (Art. 42c BankO)

Art. 42c BankO defines privileged depositors as the contracting parties
entitled under the claim relationship with the bank, as recorded in the
bank's ledgers at the time a protective measure is ordered. Joint accounts
are treated as a single deposit per joint holder unless the bank's records
clearly attribute separate portions to each holder.

13.5 Pillar 3a and Vested Benefits (Art. 42d BankO)

Art. 42d BankO provides that deposits in Pillar 3a accounts and vested
benefits accounts (Freizuegigkeitskonten) receive separate privileged
treatment up to an additional CHF 100,000 per depositor, above and beyond
the general CHF 100,000 privilege. This effectively doubles the protection
for individuals with both ordinary deposits and pension deposits at the
same bank.

13.6 Deposit Insurance -- esisuisse (Art. 42e-43 BankO)

Art. 42e BankO: Self-regulation of the deposit insurance system. All banks
licensed in Switzerland must be members of esisuisse, the Swiss banks' and
securities firms' deposit protection association.

Art. 42f BankO: Cash loans to the deposit protection provider. Banks must
be prepared to provide cash loans to esisuisse in the event of a member
bank's insolvency.

Art. 42g-42h BankO: Preparatory measures. Banks must maintain collateral
consisting of assets located in Switzerland equivalent to at least 125%
of their total privileged deposits. This ensures that sufficient assets
are available domestically to satisfy depositor claims in insolvency.

Art. 42i BankO: Depositor list and summary statement. Banks must be able
to produce, at short notice, a complete list of all depositors and their
privileged deposit amounts.

Art. 43 BankO: Payout plan. In the event of a bank insolvency, the deposit
protection scheme pays out privileged deposits up to CHF 100,000 per
depositor. The system-wide coverage limit for esisuisse contributions is
CHF 6 billion. The payout must be completed within 20 working days of
the bankruptcy order.

13.7 Exclusion for Fintech License Holders

Fintech license holders (Art. 1b persons) are NOT members of esisuisse and
are NOT covered by the deposit insurance scheme. Deposits with fintech
license holders are therefore not insured. Fintech license holders must
clearly inform clients of this fact before accepting deposits.

================================================================================
14. CAPITAL ADEQUACY CROSS-REFERENCES
================================================================================

14.1 Capital Adequacy Ordinance (CAO / ERV, SR 952.03)

The detailed capital adequacy requirements for Swiss banks are not contained
in the BankO itself but in the separate Capital Adequacy Ordinance (CAO),
which implements Basel III standards in Switzerland. The BankO establishes
the minimum capital for licensing purposes (Art. 15 BankO: CHF 10 million),
while the CAO imposes ongoing risk-based capital requirements.

14.2 Key CAO Requirements

  - Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1): minimum 4.5% of risk-weighted assets (RWA);
  - Tier 1 capital: minimum 6% of RWA;
  - Total capital: minimum 8% of RWA;
  - Capital conservation buffer: 2.5% of RWA;
  - Countercyclical capital buffer: as determined by the Swiss National Bank;
  - Leverage ratio: minimum 3%.

14.3 FINMA TBTF Requirements

Systemically important banks (too-big-to-fail institutions) face additional
capital surcharges under Art. 9-10 BankA and the implementing provisions
of the CAO, including going-concern and gone-concern capital requirements.

================================================================================
15. LIQUIDITY CROSS-REFERENCES
================================================================================

15.1 Liquidity Ordinance (LiqO / LiqV, SR 952.06)

The Liquidity Ordinance implements the Basel III liquidity framework in
Switzerland and applies to all licensed banks. Key requirements include:

  - Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR): minimum 100%, ensuring that banks hold
    sufficient high-quality liquid assets to cover net cash outflows over a
    30-day stress scenario;
  - Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR): minimum 100%, ensuring stable long-term
    funding relative to the liquidity profile of assets;
  - Intraday liquidity management obligations;
  - Liquidity stress testing requirements;
  - Emergency liquidity planning.

15.2 Fintech License Holders and Liquidity

Fintech license holders (Art. 1b persons) are not subject to the LiqO.
However, under Art. 14f BankO they must ensure that client deposits are held
in readily available form, which imposes a de facto liquidity requirement.

================================================================================
16. LARGE EXPOSURE LIMITS
================================================================================

16.1 Framework

Large exposure rules are primarily set out in the Capital Adequacy Ordinance
(CAO), with cross-references in the BankO and FINMA circulars. A large
exposure arises when the overall position vis-a-vis a single counterparty
or a group of related counterparties reaches or exceeds 10% of the bank's
eligible capital.

16.2 Key Limits

  - Single counterparty limit: 25% of eligible capital (general rule);
  - Exposures to other banks (interbank): subject to specific thresholds;
  - Exposures to central counterparties: specific treatment under CAO;
  - Group-internal exposures: must comply with limits unless exempted by FINMA.

16.3 Reporting

Large exposures must be reported to FINMA on a quarterly basis. Breaches of
large exposure limits must be reported immediately and rectified within a
timeframe agreed with FINMA.

================================================================================
17. RISK DIVERSIFICATION REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================

17.1 General Principle

The risk diversification rules (Risikoverteilung) aim to prevent excessive
concentration of risk. Banks must avoid dependence on a single counterparty,
sector, or geographic region. The CAO sets quantitative limits, while FINMA
circulars provide qualitative guidance.

17.2 Concentration Risk Management

Banks must implement:
  - Policies and limits for counterparty concentration risk;
  - Sector and geographic diversification guidelines;
  - Regular monitoring and reporting of concentration risk;
  - Stress testing for concentrated exposures.

17.3 Related Counterparties

Exposures to economically connected counterparties must be aggregated for the
purpose of applying large exposure and risk diversification limits. The CAO
defines the criteria for determining when counterparties are related.

================================================================================
18. CONSOLIDATED SUPERVISION (Art. 21-24a BankO)
================================================================================

18.1 Financial Groups (Art. 21 BankO)

Art. 21 BankO defines the concept of economic unity and mutual support
obligation within financial groups. A financial group exists when two or
more entities active in the financial sector are under common control or
management.

18.2 Group Companies (Art. 22 BankO)

Art. 22 BankO defines which entities are considered group companies for the
purpose of consolidated supervision. This includes subsidiaries, affiliated
companies, and other entities under common control.

18.3 Scope of Consolidated Supervision (Art. 23 BankO)

Art. 23 BankO establishes that FINMA's group supervision covers all group
companies active in the financial sector. FINMA may:
  - Fully include all financial sector group companies in consolidated
    supervision;
  - Partially include certain companies;
  - Exclude companies that are demonstrably independent and immaterial.

18.4 Content of Consolidated Supervision (Art. 24 BankO)

Art. 24 BankO specifies that consolidated supervision encompasses:
  - Consolidated capital adequacy (group-level CAO compliance);
  - Consolidated liquidity (group-level LiqO compliance);
  - Consolidated risk diversification and large exposure limits;
  - Group-level organizational requirements and internal controls;
  - Group-level risk management framework.

18.5 Art. 1b Persons in Groups (Art. 24a BankO)

Art. 24a BankO addresses the treatment of fintech license holders that are
part of a financial group, specifying the extent to which they are subject
to consolidated supervision.

================================================================================
19. FOREIGN BANK BRANCHES IN SWITZERLAND
================================================================================

19.1 Legal Framework

Foreign banks wishing to establish a branch in Switzerland must obtain FINMA
authorization under Art. 2 BankA and the BankO provisions on cross-border
matters (Art. 18-20 BankO), as well as the Foreign Banks Ordinance
(FBO-FINMA, SR 952.111).

19.2 Additional Authorization (Art. 18 BankO)

Art. 18 BankO requires that foreign banks obtain additional authorization
from FINMA for their Swiss operations. The conditions include:
  - The foreign bank must be adequately supervised in its home jurisdiction;
  - The home-country supervisor must have no objection to the Swiss operations;
  - The foreign bank must designate persons responsible for the Swiss branch
    who meet fit-and-proper requirements;
  - Adequate organizational arrangements specific to the Swiss branch.

19.3 Reciprocity (Art. 19 BankO)

Art. 19 BankO addresses reciprocity rights. FINMA considers whether Swiss
banks enjoy equivalent access in the foreign bank's home jurisdiction when
assessing applications from foreign banks.

19.4 Depositor Protection for Foreign Bank Branches

Deposits with Swiss branches of foreign banks are generally covered by the
Swiss deposit insurance scheme (esisuisse) if the branch is a member.
However, the extent of coverage may depend on the home-country deposit
protection regime and applicable bilateral agreements.

================================================================================
20. SWISS BANK OPERATIONS ABROAD
================================================================================

20.1 Notification of Foreign Activities (Art. 20 BankO)

Art. 20 BankO requires Swiss banks to notify FINMA before commencing business
activities abroad, whether through branches, subsidiaries, representative
offices, or other forms of presence.

20.2 Notification Content

The notification must include:
  - Description of the planned foreign activities;
  - Jurisdiction and legal form of the foreign presence;
  - Assessment of the regulatory requirements in the host jurisdiction;
  - Risk assessment for the foreign operations;
  - Organizational measures to ensure compliance in the host jurisdiction.

20.3 FINMA Oversight

FINMA retains supervisory authority over a Swiss bank's foreign operations as
part of consolidated supervision. FINMA may require that foreign operations
meet standards equivalent to those applicable in Switzerland and may cooperate
with host-country supervisors under memoranda of understanding (MoUs).

================================================================================
