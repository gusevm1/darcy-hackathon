1. OVERVIEW AND RELATIONSHIP TO THE BANKING ACT
================================================================================

The Banking Ordinance (BankO, SR 952.02) is the principal implementing ordinance
of the Federal Act on Banks and Savings Banks (BankA / BankG, SR 952.0). The
Banking Act establishes the overarching framework for bank licensing, supervision,
and depositor protection; the BankO provides the detailed rules for application.

Art. 1 BankO (Subject Matter) -- The BankO governs, for banks and Art. 1b BankA
persons: (a) licensing requirements; (b) organizational requirements;
(c) accounting and financial reporting. For banks additionally: (d) deposit
insurance; (e) dormant asset transfer/liquidation. For systemically important
banks: (f) contingency planning, recovery, and resolution.

Art. 2 BankO (Scope) -- The BankO applies to banks, fintech license holders
(Art. 1b BankA persons), private bankers, and savings banks.

Regulatory hierarchy: Banking Act (SR 952.0) > Banking Ordinance (SR 952.02) >
Capital Adequacy Ordinance (CAO, SR 952.03) > Liquidity Ordinance (LiqO,
SR 952.06) > FINMA Ordinances and Circulars > Recognized self-regulation.

================================================================================
2. LICENSING PROVISIONS (Art. 1-14 BankO)
================================================================================

Art. 2 BankO (Banks) -- Banks are entities primarily active in the financial
sector that (a) accept public deposits on a commercial basis, or (b) refinance
from multiple sources to provide financing to an indeterminate number of persons.

Art. 3 BankO (Non-Banks) -- Defines non-banks, clarifying the boundary between
regulated and unregulated entities. Entities not meeting bank or Art. 1b criteria
fall outside mandatory licensing, subject to Art. 5 and Art. 6 exceptions.

Art. 3a BankO (Essential Group Companies) -- Defines entities of material
importance for the continuation of systemically important functions, carrying
consequences for consolidated supervision and emergency planning.

Art. 4 BankO (Financial Sector Activity) -- An entity is primarily active in the
financial sector if a significant portion of revenue derives from financial
services (deposit-taking, lending, securities trading, fund management, payments).

Under Art. 3 para. 1 BankA, any entity accepting public deposits on a commercial
basis or publicly soliciting such deposits requires a FINMA banking license. The
BankO provides detailed criteria for determining these thresholds (Art. 5-6).

================================================================================
3. DEFINITION OF PUBLIC DEPOSITS (Art. 5 BankO)
================================================================================

Art. 5 para. 1 BankO defines public deposits (Publikumseinlagen) as all
liabilities to customers, except those in paragraphs 2 and 3. Any obligation to
repay funds received from the public is presumed a deposit unless excluded.

Excluded entities (Art. 5 para. 2): (a) domestic/foreign banks and supervised
entities; (b) qualified shareholders; (c) persons economically/familially
connected to qualified shareholders; (d) institutional investors with
professional treasury; (e) active and retired employees; (f) non-profit
associations/foundations/cooperatives not in finance, with min. 6-month terms.

Excluded instruments (Art. 5 para. 3): (a) contractual consideration/security
deposits; (b) bonds and standardized debt with proper prospectus disclosure;
(c) non-interest-bearing settlement balances for precious metals/securities
trading, max 60-day settlement; (d) life insurance/pension-connected funds;
(e) small prepayments for future goods/services, no interest; (f) funds with
repayment guaranteed by a licensed Swiss bank.

Art. 5a BankO (Crypto-Based Assets) -- Omnibus custody of crypto assets (without
segregation) may constitute deposit-taking. Individually segregated custody,
where assets are separately attributed to each client, does not.

================================================================================
4. COMMERCIAL OPERATION, SANDBOX, AND ADVERTISING (Art. 6-7b BankO)
================================================================================

Art. 6 BankO (Commercial Operation) -- A person acts commercially if they
(a) continuously accept deposits from more than 20 persons, or (b) publicly
solicit deposits even if fewer than 20 result.

Art. 6 para. 2-4 BankO (Regulatory Sandbox) -- Entities may accept deposits
without any license if ALL conditions are met: (a) aggregate deposits do not
exceed CHF 1 million; (b) no interest/remuneration; (c) deposits not invested
or lent; (d) depositors informed that the entity is not FINMA-supervised and
deposits are not insured. Introduced 1 January 2019 for early-stage fintech.

Art. 7 BankO (Advertising) -- Defines public solicitation of deposits, including
advertising through any medium aimed at attracting deposit funds.

Art. 7a BankO (Information Obligations) -- Disclosure of regulatory status.
Art. 7b BankO (Representations) -- Prohibits misleading representations about
regulatory status, activities, or the nature of deposits.

================================================================================
5. FINTECH LICENSE (Art. 1b BankA, Art. 14a-14g BankO)
================================================================================

The fintech license ("banking license light") permits acceptance of public
deposits up to CHF 100 million. Deposits may NOT be invested, bear interest,
or be otherwise remunerated; they must be held in readily available form.

Organizational requirements for fintech license holders:
Art. 14a: Legal form (AG/GmbH/cooperative), seat, and management in Switzerland.
Art. 14b: Business scope clearly defined and limited to fintech activities.
Art. 14c: Management from Switzerland by at least two qualified persons.
Art. 14d: Board of directors with at least three members (AG); fit and proper.
Art. 14e: Compliance and risk management proportionate to business complexity.
Art. 14f: Deposit custody -- deposits held in secure, identifiable manner.
Art. 14g: Conflicts of interest policies required.

Transition pathways: Sandbox (CHF 1M) --> Fintech License (CHF 100M) --> Full
Banking License (no limit). Transition required when thresholds are breached or
when the entity wishes to invest deposits, pay interest, or engage in lending.

================================================================================
6. MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS (Art. 15-17a BankO)
================================================================================

Art. 15 BankO (New Banks) -- Minimum fully paid-up capital: CHF 10 million.
Must be qualifying equity, fully paid at licensing, unencumbered. FINMA may
require higher capital based on activity scope, risk profile, balance sheet
size, or international activities.

Art. 16 BankO (Conversions) -- CHF 10 million minimum for entities converting
into a bank. FINMA may consider existing capital and reserves.

Art. 17 BankO (Exceptions) -- FINMA may set lower minimum capital where the
risk profile justifies it. Narrowly applied to niche institutions.

Art. 17a BankO (Fintech License Holders) -- Minimum: CHF 300,000 OR 5% of
accepted deposits, whichever is higher. Examples: CHF 10M deposits = CHF 500K;
CHF 50M = CHF 2.5M; CHF 100M = CHF 5M. Fintech holders are NOT subject to
the Basel III CAO requirements; BankO capital provisions apply directly.

================================================================================
7. ORGANIZATIONAL REQUIREMENTS (Art. 8-14 BankO)
================================================================================

Art. 8/8a BankO (Persons/Stakeholders) -- Banks must provide FINMA comprehensive
information on key persons (board, management, qualified shareholders, beneficial
owners) including CVs, criminal/debt extracts. Changes require immediate notice.

Art. 9 BankO (Business Scope) -- Must be defined in articles of association and
organizational regulations, with a business plan describing activities and risks.

Art. 10 BankO (Management) -- Effective management from Switzerland; at least two
qualified persons (dual control); fit-and-proper requirement (Gewaehr).

Art. 11 BankO (Organs) -- Board: minimum three members, majority independent;
chairman not simultaneously CEO; mandatory audit committee; risk and compensation
committees for larger institutions.

Art. 12 BankO (Function Separation/Risk Management) -- Separation of lending,
trading, asset management, and settlement. Three-lines-of-defense ICS: (1)
business units; (2) risk management and compliance; (3) internal audit reporting
directly to the board.

Art. 13 BankO (Qualified Participations) -- 10%+ capital/voting rights require
FINMA notification and approval. Changes notified before taking effect.

Art. 14 BankO (Private Bankers) -- Specific provisions for partnership structures.

================================================================================
8. PROPER BUSINESS CONDUCT
================================================================================

The Gewaehr requirement (Art. 3 para. 2 let. c BankA, implemented by BankO)
mandates that all persons managing, supervising, or controlling a bank offer a
guarantee of proper business conduct: good reputation (unbescholten), adequate
qualifications, no financial crime convictions, no pending proceedings, adequate
financial standing. This is an ongoing obligation -- FINMA may require removal
of individuals who no longer meet standards.

Banks must maintain written conflict-of-interest policies; related-party
transactions at arm's length; board/executive disclosure of outside activities.

================================================================================
9. ONGOING LICENSING CONDITIONS

Licensing is subject to continuous compliance. FINMA monitors through supervisory
reviews, on-site inspections, regulatory audit reports, and thematic reviews.

================================================================================
13. DEPOSITOR PROTECTION (Art. 42a-43 BankO)
================================================================================

Governed by Art. 37a-37h BankA, implemented through Art. 42a-43 BankO.

================================================================================
14. CAPITAL ADEQUACY CROSS-REFERENCES
================================================================================

Detailed requirements are in the Capital Adequacy Ordinance (CAO, SR 952.03),
implementing Basel III. BankO Art. 15 sets licensing minimum (CHF 10M); CAO
sets ongoing risk-based requirements: CET1 min. 4.5% RWA, Tier 1 min. 6%,
Total capital min. 8%, conservation buffer 2.5%, countercyclical buffer per SNB,
leverage ratio min. 3%. TBTF banks face additional surcharges (Art. 9-10 BankA).

================================================================================
15. LIQUIDITY CROSS-REFERENCES
================================================================================

Liquidity Ordinance (LiqO, SR 952.06) implements Basel III liquidity framework:
LCR min. 100% (30-day stress), NSFR min. 100%, intraday liquidity management,
stress testing, emergency planning. Fintech holders not subject to LiqO but
must hold deposits in readily available form per Art. 14f BankO.

================================================================================
16. LARGE EXPOSURE LIMITS
================================================================================

Primarily in CAO with BankO cross-references. A large exposure arises at 10%
of eligible capital vis-a-vis one counterparty/group of related counterparties.
Single counterparty limit: 25% of eligible capital. Interbank, central
counterparty, and group-internal exposures have specific treatments. Quarterly
reporting; immediate notification for breaches.

================================================================================
17. RISK DIVERSIFICATION REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================

Risk diversification rules (Risikoverteilung) prevent excessive concentration.
Banks must implement counterparty concentration policies/limits, sector and
geographic diversification, regular monitoring/reporting, and stress testing.
Exposures to economically connected counterparties must be aggregated. CAO sets
quantitative limits; FINMA Circular 2019/1 provides qualitative guidance.

consolidated supervision specified.

================================================================================
19. FOREIGN BANK BRANCHES IN SWITZERLAND
================================================================================

and the Foreign Banks Ordinance (FBO-FINMA, SR 952.111).

Art. 18 (Additional Authorization): adequate home-country supervision; no home
supervisor objection; fit-and-proper branch managers; adequate local organization.
Art. 19 (Reciprocity): FINMA considers whether Swiss banks have equivalent access
in the foreign bank's home jurisdiction.

Deposits with Swiss branches of foreign banks generally covered by esisuisse if
the branch is a member; extent may depend on home-country regime.

================================================================================
20. SWISS BANK OPERATIONS ABROAD
================================================================================

Art. 20 BankO -- Swiss banks must notify FINMA before commencing foreign
activities (branches, subsidiaries, representative offices). Notification
includes: activity description, jurisdiction, host regulatory requirements,
risk assessment, organizational compliance measures.

FINMA retains supervisory authority over foreign operations via consolidated
supervision and may cooperate with host-country supervisors under MoUs.
