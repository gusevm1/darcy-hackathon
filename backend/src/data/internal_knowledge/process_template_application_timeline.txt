JayBee Consulting AG — Standard Banking License Application Timeline
Version 2.4 | Last Updated: January 2026
Applicable to: Art. 3 BankA (Full Banking License) Applications

Total estimated duration: 7–14 months (typical: 10 months)

════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PHASE 1: PRE-CONSULTATION (4–6 weeks)
════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Week 1–2:   Internal assessment — evaluate client readiness, identify gaps
Week 2–3:   Prepare pre-consultation dossier (executive summary, business model, governance overview)
Week 3–4:   Submit pre-consultation request to FINMA Banking Division
Week 4–6:   Pre-consultation meeting at FINMA (Bern) + follow-up Q&A

Key Milestones:
- Pre-consultation meeting confirmed by FINMA
- Written summary of FINMA feedback received
- Gap analysis completed based on FINMA input

Tip: The pre-consultation is non-binding but sets the tone for the entire application. Present a polished, concise dossier — FINMA forms its initial impression here.

Typical Delays: FINMA scheduling (2–3 week lead time for meetings)

════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PHASE 2: APPLICATION PREPARATION (8–12 weeks)
════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Week 1–4:   Draft core application documents:
            - Business plan (3-year projections)
            - Organizational structure & governance
            - AML/CFT framework
            - Risk management framework
            - IT security concept
Week 4–8:   Board member fit & proper dossiers (see Board CV Checklist)
Week 6–10:  Capital proof documentation (bank confirmations, auditor letters)
Week 8–12:  Internal review, legal sign-off, final quality assurance

Key Milestones:
- All board member dossiers assembled and reviewed
- Capital proof documentation secured
- AML framework completed and internally validated
- Complete application package ready for submission

Tip: Start bank confirmation letters in Week 1 — they are the most common source of delays. Always prepare contingency documentation in parallel.

Typical Delays: Bank confirmation letters (2–6 weeks), candidate background checks for foreign nationals (4–8 weeks)

════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PHASE 3: FORMAL SUBMISSION (1–2 weeks)
════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Week 1:     Final completeness check against FINMA requirements catalogue
Week 1:     Submit via FINMA portal (EHP — Erhebungs- und Gesuchsplattform)
Week 1–2:   FINMA acknowledges receipt, assigns case officer

Key Milestones:
- Application submitted and receipt confirmed
- Case officer assigned and initial contact made

Tip: Submit on a Monday or Tuesday — applications submitted late in the week may not be acknowledged until the following week, which can affect deadline calculations.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PHASE 4: FINMA REVIEW (3–6 months)
════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Month 1–2:  Initial review — FINMA checks completeness, may request clarifications
Month 2–4:  Substantive review — detailed assessment of all application components
Month 3–5:  Follow-up questions (Rückfragen) — typically 1–3 rounds
Month 4–6:  Internal FINMA decision-making process

Key Milestones:
- Completeness confirmed by FINMA (no missing documents)
- First round of follow-up questions received and answered
- All follow-up rounds closed

Tip: Respond to FINMA questions within 10 business days. Fast, thorough responses signal professionalism and can shorten the review period by weeks.

Typical Delays: Multiple rounds of follow-up questions (each round adds 2–4 weeks), FINMA resource constraints during peak periods (Q4, Q1)

════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PHASE 5: DECISION & CONDITIONS (2–4 weeks)
════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Week 1–2:   FINMA issues draft decision with conditions (Auflagen)
Week 2–3:   Review conditions, negotiate where possible
Week 3–4:   Final license decision issued

Key Milestones:
- Draft decision received
- Conditions reviewed and accepted/negotiated
- Banking license granted (Verfügung)

Tip: Most licenses are granted with conditions (Auflagen). Typical conditions include: hiring specific compliance staff within 6 months, implementing IT controls before commencing operations, or submitting an updated business plan within 90 days. Negotiate unrealistic deadlines early.
