JayBee Consulting AG — Board Member Fit & Proper Dossier Checklist
Version 3.2 | Last Updated: January 2026
Reference: FINMA Circular 2017/1 "Corporate Governance — Banks" & Art. 3(2)(c) BankA

════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION 1: PERSONAL INFORMATION
════════════════════════════════════════════════════
[ ] Full legal name (as per passport/ID)
[ ] Date and place of birth
[ ] Nationality/nationalities
[ ] Current residential address (must be verifiable)
[ ] Swiss residence permit status (if non-Swiss)
    Tip: FINMA increasingly expects at least one board member with Swiss domicile

════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION 2: PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS
════════════════════════════════════════════════════
[ ] Detailed CV covering last 15 years (no gaps)
[ ] University degrees and professional certifications (certified copies)
[ ] Evidence of financial sector experience (minimum 5 years for board chair)
[ ] Specific banking/regulatory expertise documentation
    CRITICAL: Ensure at least one board member has direct Swiss banking supervisory experience — FINMA has rejected applications where no board member had prior Swiss regulatory exposure

════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION 3: REGULATORY EXPERIENCE
════════════════════════════════════════════════════
[ ] List of all current and past board mandates (last 10 years)
[ ] Positions held at FINMA-regulated entities
[ ] Interactions with regulators (FINMA, FCA, BaFin, etc.)
[ ] Any advisory roles to regulatory bodies
    Tip: Highlight experience with FINMA directly — this carries significant weight

════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION 4: CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
════════════════════════════════════════════════════
[ ] Full list of current board mandates and executive positions
[ ] Significant shareholdings (>5%) in financial institutions
[ ] Family relationships with persons at FINMA or supervised entities
[ ] Business relationships that could create conflicts
[ ] Signed conflict of interest declaration
    Note: FINMA may request additional disclosure during review — prepare candidates

════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION 5: CRIMINAL & REGULATORY HISTORY
════════════════════════════════════════════════════
[ ] Criminal record extract (Strafregisterauszug) — max 3 months old
[ ] Declaration of no pending criminal proceedings
[ ] Declaration of no regulatory sanctions or enforcement actions
[ ] Bankruptcy/debt enforcement register extract (Betreibungsregisterauszug)
[ ] Confirmation of no removal from a board by a regulator
    PITFALL: Foreign equivalents of Swiss criminal record extracts must be apostilled — allow 4–6 weeks for processing

════════════════════════════════════════════════════
COMMON REJECTION REASONS (from our experience)
════════════════════════════════════════════════════
1. Gaps in CV not explained — always include explanatory notes for career breaks
2. Insufficient Swiss regulatory experience on the board collectively
3. Conflict of interest disclosures incomplete or boilerplate
4. Criminal record extracts older than 3 months at time of submission
5. Missing evidence of ongoing professional development (CPD/CLE)
